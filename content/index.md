This is a work in progress, everything is subject to change,
be reorganised or moved to some other sub pages,
but any info still valid in game wont be removed.

All of the information you find here is comming from a [Google Doc](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing
) by @SwiftCoyote,
so thanks to him and all the people in the [Rustricity Workshop](https://discord.gg/emB98hrupy)
community that contribute to it! The Google Doc will always be a little more update then this website as the website needs to be rebuilt after each change.   

A massive Thank You to @3YE on [Discord](https://discord.gg/emB98hrupy) for creating the website and
teaching me (SwiftCoyote) how to update and maintain it.

- You could contribute code that fix or add to the website,
- But the principal thing is the accuracy of the information.  

Its made in a way so someone could edit the website content without needing
to know html/css/javascript. All the content is writen in markdown format
(similar to discord messages: \**italic*\*, \*\***bold**\*\*, etc...)
For now, I havent written something that explains how to do it but you can
ask @3YE on [Discord](https://discord.gg/emB98hrupy) for more information.
