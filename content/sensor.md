- Requires line of sight, except a player crouching under a half height floor can be seen by the sensor from above. It can also be built to see through walls, floors and roofs. 
- The only deployables that can block the HBHF are, Rustigé Egg - White, Vending Machines, Chippy Machine, Large Water Catcher, Oil Refinery and the deck of the Large Pool.
- Only outputs an amount of power equal to the number of people it detects, meaning if Power Out is connected to a Counter, set to Show Passthrough, the Counter will display the number of people the HBHF is detecting.
