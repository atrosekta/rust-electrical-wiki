Notes:

- They are used for destroying player flown aircraft, i.e. minicopter, scrap heli and hot air balloon. It doesnt matter if there is a pilot or if the pilot has TC auth. They shoot the craft, not the player, unless in Defender Mode.
- Looking at the SAM and holding Use(`E`) allows a player to enable and disable Defender Mode. In Defender Mode it will only target incoming MLRS rockets.
- To successfully defend from an MLRS attack, it is recommended placing 3 SAM Sites on the side of the base that is nearest the Abandoned Military Base and build them as high as the base is tall. 
- Has a range of 150 meters, or 1 grid square.
- It will not target anything below its own height.
- **Has Target** will pulse out 1rW if it takes damage and will release a constant 1rW if it locks a target.
- **Low Ammo** will start to output 1rW when there is 10 SAM Ammo or less. When it has no more ammo it will stop outputting power.
- **No Ammo** will output 1rW constantly when there is no more ammo.
- If 100 power is given to the SAM, 75 will come out Passthrough. 
- Must be placed on flat surfaces.
- Try to place them in a way they cannot be baited and used to destroy surrounding structures.

    - `Peacekeeper mode -` It will never attack an authorized player. It won't attack an unauthorized player unless they become aggressive. This mode also disables players from being able to control them from a Computer Station or the Rust+ app.  
    - `Attack All -`  Is the default mode and can only be selected if the turret was placed into Peacekeeper mode. This mode is required for remote control.
    - `Rotate -` Rotates the turret by 180 degrees.

    - `Clear Authorization List -` Removes all players from being authorized.
    - `Deauthorize -` Removes the player selecting it from being authorized.
    - `Set ID -` Naming the turret allows for player control. Give the turret a name, then enter that name into a Computer Station or the Rust+ app and take control. Move with the mouse and left click to shoot. Anyone can add the ID to any Computer Station and take control. Make the ID something other wonâ€™t guess and restrict access to any Computer Station with these IDs to trusted individuals only.  
- There are 3 outputs:  
    - `Has Target` will pulse out 1rW if the turret takes damage and will release a constant 1rW if it locks a target.  
    - `Low Ammo` will start to output 1rW when there is 50 ammo or less. When it has no more ammo it will stop outputting power.  
    - `No Ammo` will output 1rW constantly when there is no ammo.
- Range is 30 meters or 10 square foundations.  
- When controlled by a player from a Computer Station, the visual range is approximately 21 square foundations or 63 meters.   
- Add the ID to the `Rust+` app to control the turret from outside the game. The player must disconnect from the server before remote access is allowed.  
- The turret has a 180 degree detection arch.  
- Must be placed on flat surfaces.

Workbench Required  | Level 2
Research Table Cost | 20 Scrap
Hit Points          | 250

Notes:

- Tesla Coil deals damage at a rate of 1hp/second per rust watt up to a max of 35rW. This means if you give a tesla coil 5rW, it will do 5hp of damage per second. Give it 35rW and it will do 35hp of damage per second.
- Their damage is stackable. 100 Tesla Coils given 1rW will kill a person in 1 second.
- The range is just over 1 square foundation or 3.5 meters.
- Can be placed on all surfaces including the ground.
- With a building trick, a tesla coil can zap people through walls, floors and roofs.
- They damage themselves at a rate of 2hp/second. 
- They will not turn on if their health is at or below 62hp.
