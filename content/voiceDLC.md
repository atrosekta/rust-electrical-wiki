# Voice Props Pack DLC

The audio generated by devices like the Boom Box or Mic Stand is assigned an Audio ID by the game. This ID is what components like the Sound Light, Disco Floor and Laser Light bind to in order to react to the sound. These components can only bind to 1 ID. This means that if the Audio Out from 2 Boom Box’s were connected to an OR Switch then to a Disco Floor, the Disco Floor will bind to the ID of whichever Boom Box is the first to send some audio. The only way to remove this bind is to disconnect the Boom Box.
