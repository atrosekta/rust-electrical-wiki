## Common Traits

These tools take no damage, have a stack size of 1, are default BPs and
can only be crafted.

To change the colour of a wire/hose/pipe in place, with Wire/Hose/Pipe Tool in
hand, hold Reload `R` to select the colour then look at an IO connection
and press Reload `R`.

Wire/Hose/Pipe length is limited to 30 meters with 16 anchor points using the left
mouse button.

If a hose/wire/pipe is accidentally attached to the wall in the wrong spot, look away and right click once. It will remove the last anchor point. Holding the right mouse button down will clear the wire/hose/pipe.

To remove a hose/wire from a component, look at the connection point and
hold down the right mouse button.

Holding ‘Left Shift’ allows the placement of anchor points on deployed entities like boxes or chairs (Only Pipes ATM).

When hoses or wires are placed on walls and the wall is destroyed, the hoses and wires will remain in place, but pipes will break! They can also break when doing anything that changes the hitbox of the thing they are placed on, ie: upgrading walls can break pipes!

Wear Diving Fins to get cleaner and straighter hose/wire/pipe placement. They force the player to move slower allowing for better accuracy when strafing left and right.

Wire Tracing: Left click a pre wired connection, only that
connection will have the wire animation making it easier to follow its path.

To increase or decrease the range of the auto snap when getting close to
an IO connection, in the F1 console, change `client.lookatradius` from `0.2`
to `0.05`. This lets anchor points be placed closer to IO connections.

If the server has it enabled, turn on Wire Slack by holding the Wire Tool  and press `USE`, default is `E`. Hold Sprint, shift, to increase and Duck, ctrl, to decrease. This will give wires some slack rather than being straight between 2 points.
