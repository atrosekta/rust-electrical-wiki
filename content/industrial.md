**What is the industrial system?**  
The industrial system is a series of pipes that can connect many different containers together for the purpose of automating the movement, crafting and smelting of items. Have a look at the [Industrial Concepts]( industrialconcepts.html ) section where there are breakdowns of different systems using these components.

Active Usage        | 1
Power Consumption   | 1rw
Power Output        | Input power minus 1
Transfer Rate       | Up to 60 items per stack from 12 stacks per 5 seconds.
Despawn Time        | 5 minutes

Notes:

- The 5 second rule. From turning on to the first transfer is 5 seconds. Between each transfer is 5 seconds. This is often referred to as a tick. 
- Anyone can turn them on or off but only players with TC authorization can access the filters.
- Has 3 outputs. A passthrough, Filter Pass and Filter Fail.
- It will display an image of the item being transferred as it transfers.
- 2 Conveyors cannot be connected together in a row. They must be separated by a Storage Adapter.
- Outputs filter pass and fail, do not consume power. This is 1 free 1rW.
- `Filter Pass` will send out 1rW constantly when the conditions of the filter are met. It will continue to send power for 5 seconds when the Conveyor will check to see if the conditions are still met. If they are, Filter Pass will continue to send out power. If the conditions are not met, it will stop sending out power.
- `Filter Fail` will send out 1rW constantly when the conditions of the filter are not met. It will continue to send power for 5 seconds when the Conveyor will check to see if the conditions are still not being met. If they are still not met, Filter Fail will continue to send out power. If the conditions are met, it will stop sending out power.
- Both the Filter Pass and Fail outputs will allow the Active Usage of inactive components through. This means if the circuit is using an Inline backup, the offline components will register Active Usage on the battery causing drain.
- There is a max of 12 items that can be filtered.
- You can filter by specific items or by a general filter groups ( Ammo, Clothing, Components, Construction, Electrical, Food, Fun, Medical, Other, Resources, Tools, Traps, Weapons )
- `Filter Item settings:`
    - `MAX:` conveyor will stop moving this item when all target containers reach this amount.
    - `MIN:` conveyor will only move items in excess of this amount from all input containers.
    - `BUFFER:` conveyor will only move in chunks of this size. (When used in tandem with the MAX setting, it is useful for crafting recipes with blue prints to help eliminate overfilling and trickle filling of Industrial Crafters.)
- `Filter Mode settings:`
    - `ANY ITEM:` This is the default setting. It will move all items unless there are Item Filters being used.
    - `REQUIRE ALL:` All item filters must be satisfied before transferring materials will begin. 
        - Used for requiring more than 1 item to begin transfer.
        - This filter works as expected if only using 1 storage adapter on a single container.
        - When all items are present, Conveyor will set Filter Pass and transfer.
        - When using multiple containers with a single adapter on each, all of each item type must be contained to a single box. The single box can contain all of more than 1 item.
        - `Bug:` When using 2 storage adapters, either on a single container to 2 containers, it won't transfer anything unless it is only 1 item in 1 box. If all the items in the filter list are present, Conveyor will set Filter Fail and not transfer. 
    - `EXCLUDE LISTED ITEMS:` Only items not listed will be moved.
    - Items in the filter list will be prevented from transferring.
    - When using more than 1 filter type, the conveyor will set Filter Pass even when the item in the container is on the exclusion list.
- The `Current Items` list can be copied from one conveyor to another using the **Copy** and **Paste** buttons. Holding Sprint(`Shift`) lets a user ***Copy(JSON)***. This can then be pasted into a text file allowing a player to share their conveyor filters outside of the game and between servers. Hold Sprint(`Shift`) to ***Paste(JSON)***. This will not copy the ‘Filter Mode’.  
- If it has power when the server restoots, it will remain powered on after the restart.
- There is an Industrial Max Depth of 32 components on either side (input/output) of the Conveyor.
- There is a max of 32 Storage Adapters on either side (input/output) of the Conveyor.
- It will move stackable items in groups of 60 items from up to 12 stacks at a time. 
- Unstackable items count as 1 stack each so it will move up to 12 items at a time.
- Every additional Storage Adapter added to a container will increase the number of stacks the conveyor can take by 12.
- They can be placed on all surfaces and the ground.
- Has the ability to be rotated using Reload(R).
- The term `Item` is specifically referring to the `Item ID` number. For example, the hazmat suit has different skins but they actually have different ID’s. This should not be an issue but some items will still be transferred even though the MAX item filter has been met. One example is the Arctic and Lumberjack suits. They are hazmats but even with a MAX filter of 1, 1 of each will be sent. The default skin will always fulfill the MAX requirement and block the remodeled versions, but the remodeled versions will not block each other. This issue also exists with the following items:
    - Hazmat Suit
    - Sky Lanterns
    - AK
    - Metal Tools
    - Torches

- The blueprints spot only holds BPs.
- Blueprints craft in order from left to right.
- Items can only be crafted on the required workbench or higher. 
- The Input spots hold items that will be used in the crafting process. Items can only go in. There is no way to clear these spots without doing it manually.
- The Output spots hold the crafted items. No items can be put into these spots unless done manually.
- Input items have their one industrial connection, Industrial In.
- Output items have their own industrial connection, Industrial Out.
- Blueprints have their own industrial in and outputs, Blueprint In and Blueprint Out.
