# Fireworks

---  

They can be used on tugboats.  
  
They can be ignited with a lit Torch, Flamethrower, Fire Arrows or using
an electric Igniter.  
  
They can be placed on flat surfaces or the ground unless stated
otherwise. They can be picked up with a hammer.  
  
A firework is active when the fuse on the side of it is sparkling. If
the fuse is sparkling, it cannot be picked up.  
  
The default number of Boomers, Patterns and Champagnes that can be
active at 1 time is 25. Not 25 of each, 25 total.  
  
Type | Start Time | Launch Time | Number of shots | Time between shots | Active Time 
|---|-|-|-|-|-|
Volcano | 5 |||| 40
Candle | 5 | 2 | 12 | 3 | 40
Boomer | 5 | 5 | 10 | 4 | 47
Champagne | 5 | 5 | 3 | 10 | 35
Pattern Short Fuse | 5 | 5 | 3 | 10 | 35
Pattern Medium Fuse | 5 | 7 | 3 | 10 | 35
Pattern Long Fuse | 5 | 10 | 3 | 10 | 35

`Start Time` refers to the time between the fuse starting to sparkle and
the time the firework starts to produce color or launches a projectile.

`Launch Time` refers to the amount of time it takes a firework to reach
its maximum height.

`Number Of Shots` refers to the number of times a firework will launch a
projectile.

`Time Between Shots` refers to the amount of time between each projectile.

`Active Time` refers to the total amount of time from a firework
activating to the time it produces its last color or boom. This is also called `Duration` in the items description and is written as Start Time + the time it takes from the first projectile to launch and the last projectile to reach its maximum height. 
>Example: 5+35 seconds = 5 seconds to start then 35 more seconds before the firework finishes.
