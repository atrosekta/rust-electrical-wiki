# The RUST Electrical Handbook

*You are the []{#visitorcount}th visitor !*

A continually updated all inclusive guide to everything electrical in the game Rust. This handbook will include everything you need to find, craft, wire, and utilize different useful circuits in game. These designs have been curated from many community submissions into the simplest, cheapest, and most optimized versions possible.

This is a work in progress, everything is subject to change,
be reorganised or moved to some other sub pages,
but any info still valid in game wont be removed.

All of the information you find here is comming from a [Google Doc](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing
) by @SwiftCoyote,
so thanks to him and all the people in the [Rustricity Workshop](https://discord.gg/emB98hrupy)
community that contribute to it! The Google Doc will always be a little more update then this website as the website needs to be rebuilt after each change.   

A massive Thank You to @3YE on [Discord](https://discord.rustrician.io/) for creating the website and
teaching me (SwiftCoyote) how to update and maintain it.

# Tools

---

## Common Traits

These tools take no damage, have a stack size of 1, are default BPs and
can only be crafted.

To change the colour of a wire/hose/pipe in place, with Wire/Hose/Pipe Tool in
hand, hold Reload `R` to select the colour then look at an IO connection
and press Reload `R`.

Wire/Hose/Pipe length is limited to 30 meters with 16 anchor points using the left
mouse button.

If a hose/wire/pipe is accidentally attached to the wall in the wrong spot, look away and right click once. It will remove the last anchor point. Holding the right mouse button down will clear the wire/hose/pipe.

To remove a hose/wire from a component, look at the connection point and
hold down the right mouse button.

Holding ‘Left Shift’ allows the placement of anchor points on deployed entities like boxes or chairs (Only Pipes ATM).

When hoses or wires are placed on walls and the wall is destroyed, the hoses and wires will remain in place, but pipes will break! They can also break when doing anything that changes the hitbox of the thing they are placed on, ie: upgrading walls can break pipes!

Wear Diving Fins to get cleaner and straighter hose/wire/pipe placement. They force the player to move slower allowing for better accuracy when strafing left and right.

Wire Tracing: Left click a pre wired connection, only that
connection will have the wire animation making it easier to follow its path.

To increase or decrease the range of the auto snap when getting close to
an IO connection, in the F1 console, change `client.lookatradius` from `0.2`
to `0.05`. This lets anchor points be placed closer to IO connections.

If the server has it enabled, turn on Wire Slack by holding the Wire Tool  and press `USE`, default is `E`. Hold Sprint, shift, to increase and Duck, ctrl, to decrease. This will give wires some slack rather than being straight between 2 points.

  floors above the ground they are, not sea level.
- They will produce more power, more often the more floors above ground they are placed.
- There is a small area at the base of the turbine, on some sheet metal where you can place components.
- A turbine made on an iceberg, will calculate its output based on sea level down to the ocean bottom. This means no additional height above sea level will increase its height calculation.
- There needs to be a minimum of 15 meters or 5 foundations distance between turbines. This will prevent 1 turbine blocking the wind for another.
- Requires a single square or 2 triangles to be placed on. 
- Cannot be picked up with a hammer.

# Power Distribution

After electricity is generated, it needs a way to get to the different end devices or circuits. The primary job of these components is to create the paths for power to flow, and/or control the amount of power feeding the end devices/circuits. There is a breakdown of different distribution systems located in [Power Distribution]( powerdistribution.html ) under the Concepts section.

- These allow Power Sources and batteries to be combined to produce higher amounts of available power. [Power Sources](sources.html#power-sources) are Wind Turbines, Large Solar Panels and Small Generators.
- Can be placed on all building surfaces.
- It has a max depth of 16 components between a power source and the combiner. If max depth is reached, going any deeper will result in a shared error message, [Short Circuit/Max Depth](powerdistribution.html#Short-Circuit-/-Max-Depth).
- It does not consume any power but will register 1 [Active Usage](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed) on a battery.
- Combining batteries with a Root Combiner to get a larger amount of power is wiring the batteries in [Series](powerstorage.html#parallel-vs-series). The load is not evenly shared. For example, 2 batteries connected to a Root Combiner feeding a circuit that needs 50 power. Each battery will show an Active Usage of 50, not 25/25 to = 50.

Active Usage        | 1
Power Consumption   | 1rW
Power Output        | Power input minus 1
Despawn Time        | 20 minutes

Notes:

- Aka, a Flip Flop but has a Set, Reset and Toggle.
- The Reset input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through Inverted Output.
- The Set input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through Output.
- The Toggle input will cause the Memory Cell to flip which output power is going through.
- The side inputs are prioritized from top to bottom. This means if power is applied to Set then power is applied to Reset or Toggle, nothing will happen. If power is applied to Reset then power is applied to Toggle, nothing will happen. If power is applied to Reset then power is applied to Set, it will force the Memory Cell to send power through Output.
- When switching from one output to the other, Output will always react before Inverted Output. 
- The 2 outputs are currently bugged. When you try to see the power info by pointing at the outputs with a Wire Tool, it will show the incoming power being evenly split between both outputs. This is a visual bug. 100% of the power is only coming out of 1 of the outputs.
- Here is a [ rustrician.io](https://www.rustrician.io/?circuit=7329b23650674902a215f43e5015d563) BP explaining the Memory Cell.

Decay Time          | 96 hours

Notes:

- To configure the Counter, with a Wire Tool in hand, look at it and hold Use(E). The options are Set Target and Show Passthrough.
- Set Target allows for programming a number between 1 and 100. When the Counter is equal to the target number, or greater, the Counter will pass power through.
- Show Passthrough will show the amount of incoming power.
- When power is applied to Increment Counter, the Counter will count up
  by 1.
- When power is applied to Decrement Counter, the Counter will count
  down by 1.
- When power is applied to Clear Counter, the Counter will reset back to 0.
- The Counter does not need power to count up, down or be cleared.
- When set to Show Passthrough, if it only shows 1, connect the output (Passthrough) to any input on any component. This will cause the counter to actually pass power through so it can show the amount.
- Using a Counter on the floor on its thin side, within a 1 meter
  radius, if an item like a furnace or sleeping bag is removed, the
  Counter will also disappear. When placing or removing building
  structures, the Counter will also disappear.
- The following items can be placed on top of a counter that is placed
  down on its thin side: Lantern, Jackolanterns, carvable pumpkins,
  sandbag and concrete barricades, pookie bear, twitch trophy, eggs and
  the small candle. Placing multiple counters together to create a
  larger pad, you can put larger things like a small battery on top.

Inputs/Outputs    | Toggle, Turn On, Turn Off
Active Usage      | 1
Power Consumption | 1rW per input but none for itself
Despawn Time      | 5 minutes

Notes:

- This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
  Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.
- Requires TC authorization to change strobe settings. Look at the light
  and hold USE(`E`) to change the frequency of the strobe between 10hz,
  20hz and 40hz or to manually turn it on.
- Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that dictates the state of the light. For example, if power is constantly sent to TURN ON, the light turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the light will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF, the light will not turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. Power will need to be removed then reapplied power to TURN ON for the light to turn back on.
- The TOGGLE input will turn the light on when it receives power and turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet point. If power is applied to TOGGLE, the light will turn on. While the light is on, if power is sent to TURN OFF, the light will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE, the light will not turn back on. On the other hand if power is sent to TURN ON, the light will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the light will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, if power is removed from TOGGLE and the light will turn off. This is because when power is removed from TOGGLE, it tells the light to turn off. 
- They take damage when active at a rate of **1hp/3min42sec**.
- They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the ground.
- Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp.

Where To Find              | Requires a Steam item purchased from the market
Inputs/Outputs             | Turn On, Toggle, Turn Off
Active Usage               | 1
Power Consumption          | 1rW per input but none for itself
Low Grade Fuel Capacity    | 500
Low Grade Fuel Consumption | 1/min when active or 10/min when set to Motion
Despawn Time               | 5 minutes
Decay Time                 | 96 hours

Notes:

- This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
  Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.
- When Active, it creates a fog cloud in front of it that covers an area
  equal to a 2x2 and is thickest below half height walls. Consumes low
  grade fuel at 1 per minute.
- When set to Motion, it only gets set off by non authorized players and
  will emit fog every couple seconds creating a thicker cloud directly
  in front of it. Setting the fogger at a half wall height, the constant
  emission of the fogger creates a thick cloud at eye level. Consumes
  low grade fuel at 10 per minute.
- The fogger only emits a cloud as long as the non authorized player is
  moving. If the player stops moving, the fogger turns off.
- A cloud takes 5 seconds to form and 40 seconds to disappear.
- Increasing the number of foggers increases the density of the cloud. 4
  foggers is enough to block the light from fire and 5 will block light
  from electrical lighting.
- Fog will fall toward the ground and accumulate on any horizontal
  surface. The higher the fogger the thinner the cloud.
- Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
  hold Use(`E`) to Activate, Open or turn on Motion.
- Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that dictates the state of the fogger. For example, if  constant power is sent to TURN ON, the fogger turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF, the fogger will not turn back on, even with power still going to TURN ON. Power will need to be removed and reapplied to TURN ON for the fogger to turn back on.
- The TOGGLE input will turn the fogger on when it receives power and turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet point. If power is applied to TOGGLE, the fogger will turn on. While the fogger is on, if power is sent to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE, the fogger will not turn back on. On the other hand if power is sent to TURN ON, the fogger will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the fogger will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, when power is removed from TOGGLE, the fogger will turn off. This is because when power is removed from TOGGLE, it tells the fogger to turn off.
- They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the ground.
- Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp.

Notes:

- This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
  Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.
- When Active, it creates a patch of snow in front of the machine with a
  radius of 3.5 square foundations.
- The snow pile takes 1 second to form and 2 minutes 45 seconds to
  disappear.
- The snow at its deepest goes halfway up a character's chin.
- Increasing the number of machines does not increase the depth of the
  snow.
- Snowfall is 3.5 floors high.
- Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
  hold Use(`E`) to Activate, Open or Stop.
- The TOGGLE input will turn the machine on when it receives power and
  turn off when power is removed. When TURN ON receives power, the
  machine will turn on and stay on when TURN ON loses power. When TURN
  OFF receives power, it will always turn the machine off. If power is
  currently going to TURN OFF, sending power to the other inputs will
  turn the machine on.
- When the machine turns on, there is a 10 second window where it cannot
  be turned off.
- They can only be placed on the ground.
- Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 75hp.

# Water

# What is the water system?

It is a system that lets you collect, store, transport and distribute
water in game. It functions similarly to the electrical system in that
it has its own hand tool and you connect components in the same way.

Its primary use is for farming plants like hemp, berries and other
foods.

Gravity is something you will need to be aware of. When sending water
down towards the ground, gravity will assist you. If at any point you
need to route water up away from the ground, you will require a
component that can pump and that component will need electricity to
function.

# Industrial

**What is the industrial system?**  
The industrial system is a series of pipes that can connect many different containers together for the purpose of automating the movement, crafting and smelting of items. Have a look at the [Industrial Concepts]( industrialconcepts.html ) section where there are breakdowns of different systems using these components.

Electrical Inputs/Outputs | Power Input, Turn On, Turn Off / Electrical Passthrough, Filter Fail, Filter Pass
Industrial Inputs/Outputs | Industrial Input / Industrial Output
Active Usage        | 1
Power Consumption   | 1rw
Power Output        | Input power minus 1
Transfer Rate       | Up to 60 items per stack from 12 stacks per 5 seconds.
Despawn Time        | 5 minutes

Notes:

- The 5 second rule. From turning on to the first transfer is 5 seconds. Between each transfer is 5 seconds. This is often referred to as a tick. 
- Anyone can turn them on or off but only players with TC authorization can access the filters.
- Has 3 outputs. A passthrough, Filter Pass and Filter Fail.
- It will display an image of the item being transferred as it transfers.
- 2 Conveyors cannot be connected together in a row. They must be separated by a Storage Adapter.
- Outputs filter pass and fail, do not consume power. This is 1 free 1rW.
- `Filter Pass` will send out 1rW constantly when the conditions of the filter are met. It will continue to send power for 5 seconds when the Conveyor will check to see if the conditions are still met. If they are, Filter Pass will continue to send out power. If the conditions are not met, it will stop sending out power.
- `Filter Fail` will send out 1rW constantly when the conditions of the filter are not met. It will continue to send power for 5 seconds when the Conveyor will check to see if the conditions are still not being met. If they are still not met, Filter Fail will continue to send out power. If the conditions are met, it will stop sending out power.
- Both the Filter Pass and Fail outputs will allow the Active Usage of inactive components through. This means if the circuit is using an Inline backup, the offline components will register Active Usage on the battery causing drain.
- There is a max of 12 items that can be filtered.
- You can filter by specific items or by a general filter groups ( Ammo, Clothing, Components, Construction, Electrical, Food, Fun, Medical, Other, Resources, Tools, Traps, Weapons )
- `Filter Item settings:`
    - `MAX:` conveyor will stop moving this item when all target containers reach this amount.
    - `MIN:` conveyor will only move items in excess of this amount from all input containers.
    - `BUFFER:` conveyor will only move in chunks of this size. (When used in tandem with the MAX setting, it is useful for crafting recipes with blue prints to help eliminate overfilling and trickle filling of Industrial Crafters.)
- `Filter Mode settings:`
    - `ANY ITEM:` This is the default setting. It will move all items unless there are Item Filters being used.
    - `REQUIRE ALL:` All item filters must be satisfied before transferring materials will begin. 
        - Used for requiring more than 1 item to begin transfer.
        - This filter works as expected if only using 1 storage adapter on a single container.
        - When all items are present, Conveyor will set Filter Pass and transfer.
        - When using multiple containers with a single adapter on each, all of each item type must be contained to a single box. The single box can contain all of more than 1 item.
        - `Bug:` When using 2 storage adapters, either on a single container to 2 containers, it won't transfer anything unless it is only 1 item in 1 box. If all the items in the filter list are present, Conveyor will set Filter Fail and not transfer. 
    - `EXCLUDE LISTED ITEMS:` Only items not listed will be moved.
    - Items in the filter list will be prevented from transferring.
    - When using more than 1 filter type, the conveyor will set Filter Pass even when the item in the container is on the exclusion list.
- The `Current Items` list can be copied from one conveyor to another using the **Copy** and **Paste** buttons. Holding Sprint(`Shift`) lets a user ***Copy(JSON)***. This can then be pasted into a text file allowing a player to share their conveyor filters outside of the game and between servers. Hold Sprint(`Shift`) to ***Paste(JSON)***. This will not copy the ‘Filter Mode’.  
- If it has power when the server restoots, it will remain powered on after the restart.
- There is an Industrial Max Depth of 32 components on either side (input/output) of the Conveyor.
- There is a max of 32 Storage Adapters on either side (input/output) of the Conveyor.
- It will move stackable items in groups of 60 items from up to 12 stacks at a time. 
- Unstackable items count as 1 stack each so it will move up to 12 items at a time.
- Every additional Storage Adapter added to a container will increase the number of stacks the conveyor can take by 12.
- They can be placed on all surfaces and the ground.
- Has the ability to be rotated using Reload(R).
- `As of 7/16/2023,` stackable items that also have health, like Ladders, Solar Panels, Fuses for example, will brick the Conveyor if their health has been decreased and are unable to stack. The Conveyor will remain in a Filter Pass state because the item could be moved, but because it is unable to be placed in an existing stack, it wont move the item. Do not place these broken or damaged items in the sorting system. 
- The term `Item` is specifically referring to the `Item ID` number. For example, the hazmat suit has different skins but they actually have different ID’s. This should not be an issue but some items will still be transferred even though the MAX item filter has been met. One example is the Arctic and Lumberjack suits. They are hazmats but even with a MAX filter of 1, 1 of each will be sent. The default skin will always fulfill the MAX requirement and block the remodeled versions, but the remodeled versions will not block each other. This issue also exists with the following items:
    - Hazmat Suit
    - Sky Lanterns
    - AK
    - Metal Tools
    - Torches

# Fireworks

---

They can be ignited with a lit Torch, Flamethrower, Fire Arrows or using
an electric Igniter.

They can be placed on flat surfaces or the ground unless stated
otherwise. They can be picked up with a hammer.

A firework is active when the fuse on the side of it is sparkling. If
the fuse is sparkling, it cannot be picked up.

The default number of Boomers, Patterns and Champagnes that can be
active at 1 time is 25. Not 25 of each, 25 total.

Type | Start Time | Launch Time | Number of shots | Time between shots | Active Time 
|---|-|-|-|-|-|
Volcano | 5 |||| 40
Candle | 5 | 2 | 12 | 3 | 40
Boomer | 5 | 5 | 10 | 4 | 47
Champagne | 5 | 5 | 3 | 10 | 35
Pattern Short Fuse | 5 | 5 | 3 | 10 | 35
Pattern Medium Fuse | 5 | 7 | 3 | 10 | 35
Pattern Long Fuse | 5 | 10 | 3 | 10 | 35

`Start Time` refers to the time between the fuse starting to sparkle and
the time the firework starts to produce color or launches a projectile.

`Launch Time` refers to the amount of time it takes a firework to reach
its maximum height.

`Number Of Shots` refers to the number of times a firework will launch a
projectile.

`Time Between Shots` refers to the amount of time between each projectile.

`Active Time` refers to the total amount of time from a firework
activating to the time it produces its last color or boom. This is also called `Duration` in the items description and is written as Start Time + the time it takes from the first projectile to launch and the last projectile to reach its maximum height. 
>Example: 5+35 seconds = 5 seconds to start then 35 more seconds before the firework finishes.

# Getting Started

# The Structure of a Base Circuit

All circuits for a base follow the same basic structure. It doesn't matter if the base has 1 circuit or more, they all contain 4 main parts with an optional 5th part that does not have a static location. We have the Power Source, Battery Backup, Distribution, End Devices/Circuits and the 5th, Destruction Detection. Using the following flow chart we can help illustrate this.

![](images/image38.png)

Moving top to bottom, every circuit needs a power source. You have 3 choices, Windmills, Solar Panels or Small Generators. 

We then take our source power and feed it to a Battery Backup. You have 2 choices, Inlines or Bypasses. Either way, you must ensure you are supplying enough power to keep your batteries charged. 

From the Battery Backup, we will then need to distribute the power to the different systems in the base. There are 3 options, a Fixed or Dynamic Bus or a Configure Siphon. 

The End Devices and Circuits are your turrets, lights, cameras, farms, door controllers, sensor grids, ect. It is these components that will consume the majority of power. Knowing what circuits you want to include will be important to know when deciding how much power you need to produce and how big your Battery Backup will be.

The Destruction Detection system should be included in most circuits and if limited to one, placing one after the Battery Backup is probably the best option.

# Centralized vs Decentralized Theory
When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing electricity, we are
talking about 1 of 2 things. We are either talking about the physical
placement of components or we are talking about power flow from a source
to the end component. In a 100% completely centralized system, the
electrical circuit would collect, store and distribute power all through
a single circuit and all of this would be located in a single electrical
room/area. A 100% completely decentralized system would have independent
circuits with their own power source, battery backup, and distribution
located in different rooms/areas for each system and section of a base.
These 2 concepts exist on the extreme ends of a spectrum. The best
circuit does not need to be one or the other, it can be located anywhere
in between.  

There are several variables including the server, wipe
length, group size, the base, server limits and electrical experience
that will influence the solution that works for your situation. This is
not a 1 size fits all. The best circuit is the one that does the job you
need it to do when you need it to do it.

First we will talk about the physical placement then we will get into
the electrical circuit(s).  

# Locations  

When talking about centralizing or decentralizing the physical location
of components, it should be understood that we are NOT talking about the
auto turrets on the roof for defense. We are NOT talking about the
quality of life improvements of having electric heaters everywhere
because the build location was in the arctic biome. We are NOT talking
about the components placed on walls for the purpose of destruction
detection. What we are talking about is the location of the core
components. We are talking about the circuits that power, control
and support the defensive systems, monitoring systems or quality of life
systems. We are talking about the location of collection points for
power sources, battery backups, the batteries, power buses and all the
logic circuits for everything electric in a base. We are talking about
the location a Windmill sends its power to or the place where the wire
that powers the auto turret comes from.  

## Centralized Location

![](images/image37.png)

Where you place these components is very important because you don’t
want to make it easy for raiders to destroy them. You want to protect
your circuits like you protect your TC. Centralizing the placement of
these components in a single room or area is very convenient. It's easy
to add layers of honeycomb, add lots of traps and doors to protect but
can come at the potential risk that if raiders get into this room/area,
with 1 rocket they can destroy and disable everything. You could place
it in a spot where raiders would not think to or want to raid. When
centralizing, the location should not be an afterthought. It should be
preplanned into the base.

No matter where the room is, hiding the wires that will need to lead to
and from this room is a must. They should be either hidden out of sight
or mislead the raiders as to the rooms location. Wires are limited in
length so in smaller bases, it is much easier to reach all the
components outside the room, like auto turrets, without requiring extra
components to extend the wire. In larger bases, this can become a
problem if you don't have a safe place to put components to extend the
wires. A safe place should not be easier to destroy than the end
component itself. As an example, if you are using a memory cell to
extend a wire to an auto turret. The memory cell should not be easier to
destroy than the auto turret it connects to. When it comes to wire
extensions, any component with a passthrough works but IMO, Industrial
Lights are the best because they are cheap to craft and easy to make
look like it is just base lighting giving it the perfect camouflage.

---

## Decentralized Locations

![](images/image107.jpg)

Decentralizing the physical locations of circuits is where there are 2
or more electrical rooms/areas. These locations should be hard to find
and harder to raid. These locations should be rooms that raiders would
not think is worth raiding. The more rooms there are, the less likely
raiders will disable every system when cutting the base in half with
rockets. The larger the base is, the easier it should be spreading out
the electrical rooms/areas. The more spread out these locations are the
more protected they are and has the added benefit of not needing wire
extensions to reach end devices in a given area.

Hiding your wires is very important. Any information a raider can
collect about the locations of your electrical rooms should be
minimized. With the limitation of wire length, decentralizing can be an
excellent way of distributing power closer to where it is actually
needed. Eliminating the need to use wire extensions makes things more
secure and builders won't need to build in extra rooms just for this.
These locations could be anywhere but it is recommended you plan them
into the build for more security. Electrical rooms should not be an
afterthought just like the disconnected TC was not an afterthought.

---

# Circuits

When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing circuits, we are
talking about how we are delivering power from the source to the
different systems and end components. It is crucial to understand the
structure of a base circuit because it makes it easier to visualize the
difference between Centralized and Decentralized circuits. To help
explain this, we will use 3 different end devices/circuits. First - Auto
Turrets, Second - A HBHF grid to know where enemies are and Third -
Lights.

Centralized is a single system with all power sources, destruction
detection, batteries, power distribution and end systems connected in a
single circuit. To be more specific, all power sources get combined and
run through a destruction detector into a battery backup system. From
the battery back up we provide all of the end devices and circuits with
a single distribution system.

![](images/image70.png)

Decentralized is when we provide all of our end systems with their own
power source, destruction detection(optional), battery and power
distribution. Decentralization is a concept that exists on a spectrum.
On one extreme it could be as simple as cutting the base in half and
using 1 circuit for the North and 1 for the South or putting the turrets
on 1 circuit and keeping the HBHF and lights on another. On the other
extreme end we break every end system down as far as we want. Let's
start with auto turrets and let's say we have 15 of them. 3 per side,
North, South, East and West as well as 3 on the roof. That could be 5
separate circuits. 5 separate power sources with 5 different detectors,
5 battery backups and 5 separate distributors. Then we could also do the
same with the HBHF grind. Separate that into 5 circuits. Destruction
detection could be included in all of those circuits and separate stand
alone systems could be added for all the walls on each of the 4 sides.
Even the lights if you wanted to could be decentralized.  

![](images/image3.png)

Knowing ahead of time what systems your base will use, how much power
they consume, the size of the base and the environment being played in
(competitive vs casual), will influence your design. For best results,
design the base build around your circuits so you never need to
sacrifice functionality or security.

---

## Centralized Circuits

Here we can look at some examples of a centralized circuit. Like we
stated before, the idea is to combine everything into a single circuit.
These have the advantage of being less complex but at the disadvantage
of having single points of failure. The first circuit we can look at in
the image below is pretty simple. We have a single source of power
feeding an inline battery backup supplying power to our end components
and circuits through a single distributor. We are starting with an
inline backup because it does not scale efficiently in a centralized
environment and it is easier to see points of failure. If the battery
gets destroyed or if the first Electrical Branch gets taken out, the
entire system goes offline.

![](images/image65.png)

The trick with an Inline system is to produce enough power to keep your
battery charged but not produce so much that power is wasted. A large
battery needs a constant input of 125 to not drain if its Active Usage
is maxed out at 100. With an input of 127, it will take that battery 34
days to fully charge from empty. Always try to precharge the batteries
above 3,000rWm before letting them power the circuit. Anything above
what's needed to maintain the battery will be a waste of power when the
battery is full.

When a circuit requires more than 100 power, and the goal is still to
centralize, switch to a bypass system like the Nih Core and max out your
batteries potential. If the amount of reliable power that can be
produced is limited, the goal should be to minimize the battery's Active
Usage to a state that is manageable. The lower it is, the less power
needed to maintain the battery and the longer it will last when main
power is gone. Refer to the section titled Battery Active Usage Vs
Actual Power Consumed for a better understanding of the 2 game
mechanics.

This next example uses the same end systems but has multiple power
sources and multiple batteries to support the same or more components.
It uses the Nih Core bypass battery backup and provides power to all the
different end systems through a single distributor. The number of end
systems you want to run and the amount of power they will consume will
dictate how much power you need to generate and the number of batteries
you need to support everything in the event of a power outage. If your
circuit needs 160rW, we will use 2 large batteries. If we need 470rw, we
will use 5 large batteries. DO NOT mix and match battery sizes.

 ![](images/image12.png)

Before it was said that the above example could support the same or more
components. The Nih Core really is meant to scale up to larger power
demands but let's say the demand is only 100, that means we have built
in some redundancy. 1 turbine or battery could be destroyed and the
circuit would still function as normal. This is an expensive way of
having redundancy but it does work. This is meant to be easily scalable
to any size power load but once we start to root combine batteries, we
should try to maximize the combined batteries potential by consuming as
much as possible. This means that if we have 2 large batteries, we
should try to use as much of the 200rW as possible. When batteries get
root combined, they do not share the load as one would expect.

For example, we have a circuit with 2 large batteries supporting a load
of 50. It would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2 batteries
equals 25 per battery, but rustricity doesn't work like that. That 50
power is taken from both batteries and is seen as Active Usage.
![](images/image128.png)

This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all
the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage. Active Usage is
used to calculate how fast a battery drains. If we are forcing batteries
to max drain then we might as well try to use as much as the combined
power the batteries will provide.

It is never good practice to mix and match different size batteries. A
large battery will last 4 hours, a medium battery will last 3 hours and
small batteries will last 15 minutes. If you mix and match, you can only
rely on maximum power for the amount of time the smallest battery will
last. For example, 2 large batteries and 1 medium for a total of 250rW.
For only 3 hours will you get 250, the last hour will only provide 200.
There are situations where mixing is useful, but not for the main
battery backup on a centralized circuit.

Centralized circuits are simple, easy to work with and scalable. On
paper, you can make a centralized circuit very large and consume a lot
of power. The reality is to produce a lot and store a lot of power, you
will need a lot of land to build it on. In this next example, on paper,
we have 9 turbines on the 10th floor with 9 backup batteries feeding 36
auto turrets divided by 9 per North, South, East and West sides. It also
has 3 HBHF Sensors per side, Search Lights on each side and a bunch of
lights. The circuit is only an example and is not using its full power
potential. It could include a grid of tesla coils, destruction
detection, a camera network, automatic doors, TC/Vending Machine and
storage monitoring, an indoor garden, a system that makes your base look
online when you are offline and much more. The point here is size, very
large.

![](images/image58.png)

It is not so easy to see, with a circuit this large, and the ability to
be much larger, how one would go abouts physically building this. It
would be possible to centralize the location of the battery backup and
distribution but the size of the base will probably call for multiple
wire extensions. Any component can be used to extend a wire. The idea is
to make that component as cheap as possible. Only consuming 1 power and
being the resource cheapest component is the Industrial Lights. They are
easy to integrate as base lighting giving them the perfect camouflage.
Decentralizing the locations of a centralized circuit is possible but
difficult especially on large bases. At a certain point, you may find it
easier to just decentralize the circuit itself along with the locations.

## Decentralized Circuits

Decentralizing circuits really comes down to how extreme you want to
take it. The idea behind decentralizing is adding security and
reliability by segmenting different systems and areas with their own
independent power supplies and backups. Keep in mind, the type of
battery backup you choose is up to you but for our examples, we will
stick with inlines because it takes up less room in the pictures.

The first example shows decentralizing by separating the different end
circuits with independent power supplies and battery backups. The Auto
Turrets get their own power supply and inline battery. Same for the SAM
sites, interior lights, exterior lights and HBHF grid, they all have
their own power supply and inline battery backup.

![](images/image55.png)

While decentralizing based on end circuits is an option, if the battery
powering that circuit gets destroyed, that entire circuit will become
disabled. Having all your auto turrets go offline during a raid is never
a good thing. A more secure option would be to decentralize by location.
To keep the idea simple for the next example, let's breakup a base into
5 sections, North, South, East, West and the roof. By giving each group
their own power supply and backup, it prevents the entire base from
going offline when raiders destroy both the power supply and battery
backup. Decentralizing the circuit makes it a lot easier to decentralize
the locations. Wire length is limited, so depending on the size of the
base, being able to put the power source, battery backup and
distribution in a location that minimizes the need to wire extensions is
very appealing. If the base is of a smaller size, putting the power
supply, battery backup and distribution on the North side that powers
the South side has the clear advantage that in the event raiders come
through the South side, when they hit the electrical room on the South
side, it only disables the North side of the base. It is recommended
that when needing to extend wires, if you can't put the extension
component in a protected area, use an industrial light and integrate it
into your base lighting.

![](images/image54.png)

## Hybrid Circuits

A hybrid circuit is one that both centralizes, for convenience, and
decentralizes, for security, different parts of the same circuit. While
it is more common to see hybridization between power sources and battery
backup, it can also be done with distribution. To help demonstrate this
concept, we have the following 3 examples. The first 2 are using Inline
Battery Backups because it's the easiest way to demonstrate the concept. In each example, a Counter is used to both show the
available amount of power but also represents an end circuit like lights
or turrets.

This first example demonstrates decentralizing the main power by having each power source charge its own battery, with a centralized Inline backup by combining the batteries before powering a circuit. This is a less than ideal way to set up your power production and battery backup. Keep in mind that Root Combiners do not share the load between batteries. This means that a circuit needing 100 power or more will force all the batteries to have a max Active Usage of 100. 
Read the section [Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumed](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed) for an in depth explanation into Active Usage.  

![](images/dectr-pwr-ctr-bkp.png)  

This kind of battery configuration is convenient to achieve a lot of power on 1 line but because in this example we are using Inline batteries, this becomes progressively more expensive to maintain as you need to be producing a significant amount more power than you need to. This also removes the ability to take advantage of game mechanics to minimize Active Usage on the batteries which should be a primary focus when using an Inline backup. 

Let's say you want to power 18 Auto Turrets. That is 180rW plus the cost of distribution so we are going to need 2 large batteries which give us 200 power, just like in the picture below. With no load sharing between the batteries, they both will have an Active Usage of 100. With the battery’s 80% efficiency, we need to give each battery 125rW. That’s a minimum of 250rW we need to produce all the time so the batteries do not drain.

![](images/centbat250.png)

If you have already read Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumed, you will know it is possible to power 9 turrets from 1 battery. Pictured below, if we power 9 turrets from 1 battery and the other 9 from the other battery and each battery has its own power source, this allows each battery to only have an Active Usage of 90.  With the batteries 80%, we only need a power supply of 114rW per battery for a total of 228rW to not lose power. 

![](images/decentbat228.png)

The larger this is scaled up, it is easy to see how much wasted power, time and materials there are when trying to centralize the batteries when each battery has its own power source. That is why it is seen as unsustainable for use in situations that are continuously online, however, if you have a circuit that spends most of its time offline and there are long enough periods of time between activity to let the batteries charge, then it becomes much more practical to just get a lot of power on a single line for a shorter period of time.  

In the next example we demonstrate centralizing power by combining it before the Inline batteries, while decentralizing the battery backup by letting each battery power its own circuit. This gives us the benefit of convenience by combining all the power sources into a single line then using Splitters to evenly divide that power between all batteries,

![](images/ctr-pwr-dectr-bkp.png)
 
or, like in the above picture, use an
Electrical Branch to give priority to 1 battery while evenly dividing
the remaining power between the other 2. This gives us the ability to
prioritize batteries and also take advantage of minimizing Active Usage
per battery depending on the circuit it is powering. This leads to a
lower material and labor cost and wastes less power.

Decentralizing the batteries is almost always the better option when creating a hybrid circuit. While the above examples have used Inline battery backups, in our 3rd example, we use a bypass battery backup known as the Nih Core.

![](images/decentnihcore.png)  

This battery backup is natively a centralized system but here, we have decentralized the batteries by dedicating them to specific systems. This is called the Decentralized Nih Core. We have combined the power sources before sending power into the Nih Core. Instead of having the batteries combined, which is traditional, we are instead separating the batteries so they each only backup a smaller portion of the circuit. It still gives us the benefit of powering our circuits the majority of the time with a centralized main power source but it is also providing security by decentralizing the battery backup. If the main power source or the core is destroyed, the batteries will take over. If the main power source or the core is not destroyed but a battery is, the circuit will remain powered by the main power source. Only once both are destroyed will a circuit go offline. If you want to build in some prioritization, what circuit is last to kick on to the battery, you can replace the Main Power Splitter with an Electrical Branch.

![](images/hybrid2.png)

Replacing the Splitter with an Electrical Branch allows you more control over what circuit is the first to lose power and kick on to battery vs the last to kick over to battery. On the Electrical Branch, the output Branch Out lets you dedicate a specific amount of power to a circuit while the output Power Out sends out the remaining amount. As power falls, the circuit that is connected to Power Out will be the first to lose main power and switch over to battery backup before the circuit connected to Branch Out switches over to battery backup.

# Distribution

Incomplete*  

Centralized distribution is how 99.9% of all circuits are wired as illustrated in the picture below. All end devices or circuits are fed from a single source of power using a single battery backup following the path of a single distributor.  

![Alt text](images/CentDist.png)  

Decentralized distribution at its simplest is using OR Switches (outlined by purple in the picture below) to send power to each end device (or circuit) from 2 or more power sources, battery backups or distributors.

# Power Generation

# Wind Power
Generating power from the wind with Wind Turbines is the most common way to generate rustricity.  They are very reliable and can produce anywhere from 0rW up to 150rW. Wind Turbine power is greatly influenced by tower height to buildable ground and surrounding structures.

How close to a Wind Turbine is too close? That answer is 15 meters or 5 square foundations. Wind Turbines are large deployables and need a lot of room. If something is blocking the path of the wind, the turbine will produce zero power until the wind shifts direction. The picture below shows an area called ‘Restricted Build Zone’. Building outside of this area is completely safe. Building within the restricted zone could lead to blocking the wind but if some precautions are taken.
 
![](images/windbuildarea.png)

Building within the restricted zone is possible and it’s easier than people think. There is an invisible beam that sticks out the front of the turbine, at the intersection of the blades. It is inline with the horizontal drive shaft and sticks out 15 meters, or 5 square foundations. If this beam gets blocked by something a player deploys or builds, the turbine will stop spinning and stop producing power.

![](images/windbuildbeam.png)

This beam is not very thick and its height is just over 2 floors high. As long as there are no obstructions out to 15 meters, the turbine will continue to produce power. Obstructions are anything from building structures to deployable items.This next picture shows where walls and floors can be placed below the beam without interfering with power production.


![](images/windbuildrestrict.png)

It is technically possible that something could be built in the area that would be the 3rd floor, but floors can’t be suspended. Using double door frames to support the floor from below will block the wind from time to time. Also, using angled roofs on the 2nd floor will block the wind. 

`Fun fact`, the turbine always rotates clockwise and it takes 1 hour to complete a full 360 degrees.

![](images/windbuildrocation.png)

Knowing how close to the Wind Turbine structures and deployables can be placed is the first step. The next part is knowing how high they need to be built. The higher a turbine is placed, the more power it will produce on average. Height is referring to the distance between the turbine and the buildable ground below it. This means there is no difference between a turbine built on ground level at the beach or on the top of a mountain. If they are built at the same height off the ground, they will both produce the same amount of power. The next image is showing us how much average power can be expected when it is built above ground level.

![](images/windbuildhight.png)

When measuring height, people will regularly refer to how tall or high their Wind Turbines are by counting the number of floors down to the foundations. This is a very easy way to relay information to everyone that plays Rust but if it was necessary to be more accurate, the height of the foundation could be taken into account.

![](images/windbuildfoundations.png)

The strength of the wind varies over time. This means the amount of power a Wind Turbine produces fluctuates up and down. It is the reason why an average is used when talking about how much power a Wind Turbine produces. To help illustrate this, in the picture below, the blue line shows the amount of power a turbine at ground level was producing over the period of an hour. It consists of approximately 180 data points. The red line is what is said to be the average output for a turbine at ground level.  

![](images/windaveragetime.png)

The picture above is from a random hour and its purpose is to show the randomness of wind. During this hour, the turbine's max output was only 113rW and its lowest output was 39rW. If this graph was stretched out to 100+ hours, it would show that the most common fluctuations are about 50rW + or - the average output. However, at some point, if the graph was stretched out long enough, we would see the turbine max out and produce 150rW. Likewise, we would also see its production drop to 0rW. The higher the turbine is, the more often it will max out at 150rW. The lower the turbine is, the less often it will max out at 150rW. At all heights, they have an equal chance to hit 0rW though it is very rare. Due to this fluctuation, the most reliable thing to do was find the average over a long period of time and that is how 93rW on the 6th floor became the number that is used today. 

If average output means that 50% of the time the turbine is producing more or less power, then with the same data points, it's also possible to find out the amount of time a turbine will be producing a specific amount of power or more for. For example, let’s say there was a need for a turbine to produce 30rW but it had to produce that much 99.9% of the time. How high would this turbine need to be? In this next picture, there are examples of the 2nd, 6th and 9th floors. Using this data, a turbine built 6 floors or more high, would be able to supply 30rW, 99.9% of the time. If anyone would like to collect the data for the remaining floors, I'd happily add it.

![](<images/unknown (3).png>)

Knowing this detailed information is not a necessity but if it is understood, it will help prevent running out of power, or better yet, being more efficient. Knowing how much power a circuit needs will help determine how many turbines need to be built and at what height they should be placed. The inverse of that is also true. If the number of turbines and their height is limited, knowing how much power that can be reliably produced will determine how big the circuit can be.

This next image is a very nice breakdown specifically for the Inline battery backup. It shows the turbines average power per floor and the usable amount of power from a battery. It also shows how many Auto Turrets a single Wind Turbine and Large Battery combo could support. It even shows how much stone each Rust Watt costs when building dedicated Wind Turbine towers. The stone calculations are now a little low. There was an update to the game that prevents turbines from being built on the tops of double door frames. Now a floor is needed under them which adds to the stone cost.

# Solar Power

On Console:
Point the panels South.

On PC:
Depending on the time of year, the Sun will take a different path through the sky. Most Rust players live in the northern hemisphere. Places like Europe and North America. It is normal to have summers in June and winters in December. Rust island is located in the southern hemisphere, like Australia. This means winters are in June and summers are in December. 

- The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year. The Sun will travel its most Northern path. On this day, the sunrise is the latest and sunset is the earliest. During the winter months, solar panels capture less power.
- The summer solstice is the longest day of the year. The Sun will travel its most Southern path. On this day, the sunrise is the earliest and the sunset is the latest. During the summer months, solar panels capture more power.

In the picture below, it shows how the Sun will traverse the sky over 6 Rust months or 7ish real days. A day in the game is an hour of real time. This means it takes about 15ish days for a full Rust Year. 

![](images/chart.png)

Wipe day is always May 20th 2024. Depending how long or short the wipe is, and where on the map a Solar Panel is located, might determine the direction the Solar Panel is placed. If the wipe is 5 days or less and the panel is located on the southern tip of the island, facing it North would be acceptable. However, if the wipe is any longer than that, the idea of having to pick up the panels to reangle them does not sound like fun. Placing a panel facing East and a panel facing West is the best way to set it and forget it. 

Solar Panels will produce power when the face of the panel can see the Sun. The Sun rises in the East and sets in the West. To take full advantage of a Solar Panel, try to capture the Sun in the morning the moment it rises above the horizon, and all the way to the moment the Sun drops below the horizon at night. In order to accomplish this, line of sight to each horizon is required. 

Things like the ground, cliffs, trees and building structures can all block the Sun. Avoid placing solar panels in their shadows. Solar Panels need an unobstructed view of the Sun as much as possible. Deployables do not appear to block the Sun.  

The best chance of achieving line of sight to both horizons is by building on top of the highest mountain.
![](images/SwiftMountain_Export_1.png)
Otherwise, in the mornings, Eastward facing panels on the West side of the map will need to wait for the Sun to get high enough in the sky to clear the hills and mountains. The panels on the East side could catch the sun the moment it peaks above the horizon.

![](images/SwiftMountain_Export_2.png)
In the evenings, Westward facinging panels on the East side of the map will have the amount of time they could produce power cut short as the Sun moves behind the hills and mountains. The panels on the West side could catch the sun up to the moment it drops below the horizon.

![](images/SwiftMountain_Export_3.png)

Only an admin can get the exact date and time. This is what players cannot see.  

![](images/admintool.png)  

Watching where the Sun rises and sets on the horizon can give a player an idea of the time of year. Some modded servers will have a plugin that gives players a clock and might show the sun up and down times. Some might even show the date.

If a pair of panels are placed so each could see either the East or West horizons, the following could reasonably be expected, within a reasonable margin or error.

**The Winter Solstice (June 20 2024):**   
- Solar Panels facing East can start to capture the Sun around 7:10am. Power levels will slowly increase until around 9:05am when they will be producing a full 20rW. This lasts until about 1:30pm. Around this time, it will slowly start decreasing power production until around 3:45pm when it stops.  
- The panel facing West can start to capture the Sun around 11:40am. A few minutes later at around 1:45pm, it will start producing a full 20rW. Around 6:15pm the panel will start decreasing the amount of power produced until about 8:15pm when it stops.  
- During the winter solstice, 2 combined panels, 1 facing East and 1 facing West, can collect around 940rWm of power.

**The Summer Solstice (December 21 2024):**  
- Solar Panels facing East can start to capture the Sun around 6:30am. Power levels will slowly increase until around 8:20am when they will be producing a full 20rW. This lasts until about 2:30pm. Around this time, it will slowly start decreasing power production until around 4:15pm when it stops.
- The panel facing West can start to capture the Sun around 11am. A few minutes later at around 1pm, it will start producing a full 20rW. Around 7pm the panel will start decreasing the amount of power produced until about 9pm when it stops.
- During the summer solstice, 2 combined panels, 1 facing East and 1 facing West, can collect around 1075rWm of power.

When working with solar panels for a primary source of power, it is very helpful to know how to calculate how much capacity a circuit needs to last 1 in game day. Knowing the capacity will dictate how many panels are needed. Base the number of panels used on the lowest amount of power they will produce on the shortest day of the year.

**The Maths:**  
`rWm`: rust watt minutes (capacity)  
`rW`: Rust Watt (aka power)  
`S`: Seconds  
`τ`: 60 (The number of seconds in a minute, and minutes in an hour)  
`M`: Minutes  
`O`: The amount of power(rW) you want to output  
`H`: Hours  

To figure out how much capacity is needed to support a circuit of a specific load, use the following equation:  
`O × τ = rWm`

To figure out how many pairs of panels are needed to support a specific amount to power, use the following equation:
`rWm ÷ 940rWm = Solar Panel pairs`

Example: A circuit with an active load of 64rW.  
`O × τ = rWm`  
`64 × 60 = 3840rWm`  
Therefore a circuit needing a constant 64rW over the course of 1 hour will consume 3840rWm worth of power.   
`rWm ÷ 940rW = Solar Panel pairs`  
`3840rWm ÷ 940rW = 4.08`  
Therefore 5 pairs of panels are needed to capture enough rWm to cover the power cost of a 64rW circuit. 2 solar panels make a pair, so 10 panels total.

To figure out how much time a given capacity will run for, outputting a specific amount of power, we use the following equations:
`Seconds: (rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S`  
`Minutes: rWm ÷ O = M`  
`Hours: (rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H`

# Power Storage

TL:DR
- Batteries can accept incoming power at the same time they are sending power out.  
- Charging rate is dependent on the amount of power coming in, with an efficiency of 80%.  

> *Example:* 20rW from a Solar Panel × 0.8 = 16rW usable through a battery.  

> *Example:* If your Medium Battery is supplying 16rW to a circuit, 16 ÷ 0.8 = 20rW is the minimum you want to give the battery so it doesn’t lose any charge.

- It is recommended to supply slightly more than you need if you want to charge the battery.  
- When you combine batteries with Root Combiners, they do not split the load as one would expect. They cannot see each other, so each battery tries to power the whole circuit.  

> For example, in a circuit with 2 root combined batteries supporting a load of 50, it would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2 batteries equals 25 per battery. Rustricity doesn't work like that and 50 power is taken from each battery and seen as Active Usage on both batteries. This means both batteries are draining at a rate of 50.  

This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage, which is used to calculate how fast a battery drains.  
So if we are forcing batteries to max drain, then we might as well try to use as much of the power the combined batteries will provide.

When using a bypass battery backup like the [ Nih core ]( powerstorage.html#nih-core ),
Active Usage does not matter because the circuits are getting power from the main power source most of the time and not the battery.

- Rustricity has its own version of [Parallel and Series](powerstorage.html#parallel-vs-series) battery configurations.
- 1rw will charge a Large Battery in 34 IRL days.
- When a battery is depleted because it is not receiving enough power, no power is outputed until it charges up for a couple seconds before
outputting to the connected circuit. The battery still not receiving
enough power will deplete in a second and the process repeats.  
- If the circuit after a battery is turning on and off,
you do not have enough power charging your batteries.
- When they get picked up, they lose 25% HP but retain their current
capacity. This means if a large battery has a full charge, when you pick
it up and place it back down, it will still have a full charge.
- Batteries have something called Active Usage and components have
something called Power Consumption. Read about it in [Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumed](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed).

# Battery Backup

There are 2 types of battery backup systems. There are Inline Backups and there are Bypass Backups. Inline backups include the Inline and The Kore. Bypass backups include the OR/Blocker and the Nih Core. Deciding which backup to use really comes down to preference. They each have their own pros and cons and some may argue that 1 is better than another in different situations. For example, if you only need to power a few turrets and are in a hurry, you might find the simplicity of the Inline backup works for you. Maybe you are working with 300rW to 1000rW and a dozen Windmills, you might find the efficiency of the Nih Core is preferred. At the end of the day, as long as the battery backup you go with, works when you need it to work, that was the right backup to choose.

---

# Direct Delivery

![](images/image86.png)

This is when the power source is directly connected to a circuit. If the power source is destroyed or stops producing power for any reason, the circuit will go offline. This method is a great solution for short term uses like getting some auto turrets asap for your clan or getting some water pumps online early for a berry farm. While this method is good for a very short time to get an early game advantage, it is not recommended to rely on this method for any length of time. Introducing batteries to a circuit to create backup power is more suited for long term use.

Pros:

- Easy to wire
- Minimal components
- Early game advantage

Cons:

- If power source is destroyed the components turn off
- No backup power
- Short term use only

---

# Inline

![](images/image26.png)

This is called an Inline because power must pass through the battery before powering something. Inline batteries are the most common and easiest way to provide a battery backup. This method is fast to make and wire. It is reliable assuming enough power is being produced to keep the batteries charged. It is also an easy way to decentralize circuits. When a power source is directly connected to a battery, 100% of that power is used for the sole purpose of charging that battery. When a battery is fully charged, any power above what is needed to maintain the battery’s charge, is not being used, which we call wasted. 

Batteries are 80% efficient and have a mechanic called Active Usage. There is an entire section about this but for right now, to figure out how much power a battery must be given so it doesnt drain, take the Active Usage number and divide that by 0.8. Active Usage can be found by holding a Wire Tool and looking at a battery. 

> For example, a large battery with an Active Usage of 100. 100 ÷ 0.8 = 125. Therefore, 125rW needs to be provided to prevent the battery from draining. 

If the battery is being given 150rW so it charges, when it is fully charged, there is 25rW of power that is not being used. When it needs to be charged, that 25rW is better then 1rW because it will charge faster. Giving a Large Battery only 1rW, it will take roughly 34 IRL days to fully charge. For 1 battery, 25 extra doesn't seem like a lot, but when using 4 or more batteries, that can be 100rW of power being “wasted”. 

One of the biggest benefits of an Inline backup is when the power source stops making enough or any electricity, the battery will continue to supply power, uninterrupted. This means that unlike bypass backs, the inline is not prone to a flicker off/on when the power source is not producing enough power. The battery will continue to power the circuit until it is depleted or destroyed. 

It is recommended to start charging batteries as soon as possible. Let them charge to a minimum of 3000rWm before letting them power anything. The reason for this is if a Wind Turbine is used, the wind could be entering a slow period. When using Solar Panels, night comes once an hour. Having some capacity saved up will help get through the slow or no times.
 

Pros:

- Simple to make with minimal electrical components
- Perfect for decentralizing circuits

Cons:

- Inefficient use of power at large scale

# The Kore

This is an Inline backup, but different. The battery still powers the circuit all of the time until the battery gets destroyed. When that happens, the circuit will switch over to main power. Check out the [demo here](https://streamable.com/ugrbkl)

# OR/Blocker 

![](images/ORblocker.png)

This method has been around for a long time and is often called ‘Infinite Power’. It is not infinite power, it is just a bypass battery backup. It has been carried over from a previous version of electricity when batteries could only charge or discharge, not both at the same time. During this time batteries did not have an Active Usage and forced out max power causing the need to invent the ‘Infinite Power Loop’, which actually was something, but it was not this circuit. 

This is an OR/Blocker battery backup. It is a bypass battery backup that powers a circuit most of the time from the main power source. Power is bypassing the battery to power the circuit, while the excess power is used to charge the battery. When not enough power is produced, it will automatically switch on the battery keeping everything powered. The reason it is now considered out of date is because it doesn’t take advantage of the batteries ability to charge and discharge at the same time. 

The way this method works is by sending power into the first Electrical Branch and branching out enough power to meet a circuit's needs. That power is passed to an OR Switch which sends power to a circuit. The extra electricity from the first Electrical Branch is sent to another Electrical Branch. Power is branched out to block the Blocker which prevents the battery from draining. The extra power is then used to charge the battery. When there is not enough power to keep the battery blocked, the battery sends power out to the OR Switch to keep the circuit online. 

Based on the picture below, green wire showing what has power, red showing no power and yellow showing wasted power. If the Windmill only produces 75 power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first
 
![](images/orblockerstates.png)
Electrical Branch or block the battery. The battery takes over powering the circuit but the 75 power is still coming out of the first Electrical Branch. The power is still there, it is just not being used, it is wasted. 

While considered out of date today for use as a primary battery backup system, with some small modifications, it is useful as a secondary battery backup which we talk about in its own section. 


Pros:

- Easy to understand
- Simple to build

Cons:

- Wasteful when using battery power
- Ignores the battery update to allow charging and discharging at the
  same time

# Nih Core 

![](images/image87.png)

The Nih Core is the modern version of, and replacement for, the OR/Blocker. When using an inline battery to power a circuit, there is a 20% loss due to the batteries inefficiency. Bypass battery backups, like the Nih Core, are a way around this. Instead of a circuit being powered by the battery, the circuit gets power directly from the Wind Turbine while the battery gets charged with the excess. The Nih Core will automatically switch over to the backup battery when the power source is not producing enough. 

The Nih Core becomes more efficient the more batteries it has but there is only 1 in the picture because it's all that is needed to demonstrate how the Nih Core functions. The simple explanation is when there is not enough power to meet a circuit's requirements, it redirects the insufficient amount of power to the battery and activates it to take over powering the circuit. The reason the Nih Core becomes more efficient with more batteries is because we are bypassing the 20% hit from an inline battery and we don’t care about the battery’s Active Usage. We are bypassing the battery therefore removing any restrictions or conditions caused by it. Check out the section called ‘Battery Active Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed’ for an in depth explanation.

Using the following picture, it is possible to see where power exists and where it doesn’t when the Nih Core is running off of Main Power vs Battery Power. The green wires have power and the red wires do not.

![](images/nih-core-paths.png)

To understand how this works, becoming familiar with the Memory Cell and the Splitter will help a lot. The inputs on the side of the Memory Cell are prioritized from top to bottom and when the Splitter receives power, it sends out power from left to right. This also applies to when Splitters lose power, they stop sending power out from left to right. The section ‘Circuit Delay and Power Flow’ helps explain in detail how rustricity moves around a circuit.

Based on the picture above, if the windmill only produces 75rW of power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first Electrical Branch, which is set to 100. That first Electrical Branch will still send that 75rW to the Memory Cell. This means no power is going to the second Electrical Branch, therefore the Splitter loses power. When the Splitter loses power, Output 1 first stops sending power to SET on the Memory Cell. At that moment, power from Output 2 is still going to RESET, so the Memory Cell flips outputs. RESET loses power followed by Output 3 going to Block Passthrough on the Blocker. The battery then takes over powering the circuit. The 75rW of power that is still going through the first Electrical Branch and Memory Cell, is now sent to the battery extending its life instead of being wasted. This will take a 4 hour backup time and extend it.



![](images/ctr-nih-core.png)

Here is a look at a Nih Core with 4 batteries. Keep in mind Max Depth
when using large numbers of power sources and batteries. 16 power sources and 16 batteries is the most you can connect
before hitting the Max Depth. Check out the section ‘Short Circuit / Max
Depth’ for an in depth explanation on that subject.

If you notice that power is flickering off/on when switching between
main power and battery power, it is because 1 of 2 issues.

![](images/nihcoresolutions.png)

**Solution 1 -** If using only 1 battery, add a Root Combiner between the battery and blocker to keep the battery active. If the battery does not have something registering Active Usage, it will enter an inactive state. This causes a delay when switching on to battery power waiting for the battery to wake up. 

**Solution 2 -** If already using a Root Combiner or using more than 1 battery, add 1 or 2, maybe even 3 components between the Memory Cells ‘Output’ and the OR Switch. This will hold power here longer giving the circuit a chance to receive power from the battery.

**Solution 3 -** Use a secondary inline battery backup to buffer against the flicker on circuits that need stability. In the picture below, the purple wires are representing a destruction detection system on some walls. Then the flicker happens, the Smart Alarm gets triggered. Adding the battery prevents that from happening. It does cost 20% more power for that circuit because of the battery, but it is 100% stable. The yellow wires represent circuits that do not need 100% stability. It could be deemed acceptable if these circuits turn off and on once in a while.

# Secondary Battery Backup

A secondary battery backup is used to provide power to a circuit after the main backup system goes offline. It's a backup of a backup. The chance that a secondary backup battery gets used on a typical day is near 0%, so why use them? Why not? The only drawback is the increased power cost. More backups and redundancy never hurts functionality, it only adds to it.

There are a couple of different versions of the secondary backup. Just like primary battery backups, there is the inline and the bypass. Secondary backups can be built into any place in any circuit. 

The first and easiest way is installing an inline battery between a circuit and its power bus. Let's use a picture to illustrate a circuit that is using a Nih Core as a primary battery backup with Inline batteries for the secondary backup.

![](images/secbatbkup.png)  

The secondary batteries are installed between the Electrical Branches and what the branch is providing power to. In the case of the Auto Turrets, instead of the Electrical Branch sending power straight to the Smart Switch, the branch sends power to a battery that then powers the switch and all the turrets. It’s the same for the SAM Sites. Power from the branch powers a battery and the battery powers the SAMs. Remembering that batteries are only 80% efficient, the amount of power each Electrical Branch provides is increased to compensate. With a secondary battery, the branch sending power to the turrets is set to 115. Without the secondary, it only needs to be set to 99. That's a 16rW  difference. The branch sending power to the SAM Sites is set to 96 but without the secondary battery, it only needs to be set to 76. That's a 20rW difference. For a total cost of 36rW, both the turrets and the SAMs will have a runtime of 8 or more hours if the main power source is completely destroyed. 

Another thing that should not be forgotten is that it takes 34ish days, or over 800 hours, to charge a large battery with  only 1rW. In other words, precharging secondary batteries should be a requirement. Once a battery is fully charged, providing it with any more then exactly what it needs to not drain, is wasted power that could maybe be better used elsewhere. The maximum input a battery can accept is 4x its output. That means 400rW could be sent to a large battery and have it fully charged in approximately 1 hour 15ish minutes.

The inline secondary battery is the easiest but paying the 20% tax for the battery can make this version not so attractive. So let’s have a look at a bypass secondary backup which has a static tax of only 3rW. This is essentially an OR/Blocker backup except the battery gets installed precharged and there is no built in way for it to be recharged. Let’s use the picture below to help illustrate how it works. 

![](images/secorblk.png)

The Test Generator represents static power coming from your main battery backup system. This means power levels won’t go up or down like wind and solar. When the Electrical Branch loses just 1rW, the battery will take over. What is more likely is that power will either be present or it will not. This battery should never be used so there is no built in recharging system. This saves wasting power recharging a battery that will probably never be used so it must be precharged. 

This secondary backup gets installed just like the inline version, between the circuit and its power bus. The picture below illustrates the same circuit as before using a Nih Core as a primary battery backup but now with a bypass battery for the secondary backup.

![](images/secbatbkup2.png)  

The secondary batteries are installed between the Electrical Branches and what the branch is providing power to. In the case of the Auto Turrets, instead of the Electrical Branch sending power straight to the Smart Switch. Power is sent to another Electrical Branch that blocks passthrough on a Blocker before sending a specific amount of power on an OR Switch. From there, it’s on to the Smart Switch and all the turrets. It’s the same for the SAM Sites. Power from the branch goes to another Electrical Branch that blocks a Blocker before sending power to an OR Switch. From there it's off to power the SAMs. 

The ability to bypass the battery means the amount of power each Electrical Branch provides only needs to be increased by 3rW to compensate. With a secondary battery, the branch sending power to the turrets is set to 98. Without the secondary, it only needs to be set to 95. That's a 3rW difference. The branch sending power to the SAM Sites is set to 79 but without the secondary battery, it only needs to be set to 76. That's also a 3rW difference. For a total cost of only 6rW, both the turrets and the SAMs will have a runtime of 8 or more hours if the main power source is completely destroyed.

Adding a recharging system can be done. It is just the OR/Blocker battery backup. The only drawback is the added power cost. If a player is OK with that, then go for it. 

Pros:

- Uses only a few components so it's easy to build and wire
- Can be efficient for redundant backup power
- Can be inserted into almost any circuit at any point

Cons:

- Requires a pre charged battery
- Added costs for redundancy

# Battery Active Usage VS Actual Power Consumed

Simply put, Active Usage is what a battery uses to calculate its charge
and discharge rate. Power consumed is the amount of power a component
requires to operate. Active Usage doesn't always = Power Consumed. This
is also where the argument of Electrical Branch vs Splitter comes from.
Once you understand this section, you will know the answer to this
age-old argument.

When you look at the battery with a wire tool, you will see Active
Usage. Active Usage is the amount of power the battery is draining by.
This is the number you want to use when calculating how much power to
give a battery for it to remain charged based on the battery's 80%
efficiency. Active Usage ÷ 0.8 or Active Usage × 1.25 gives you the minimum power input to remain neutral.

![](images/large-battery-ui.png)

It is reasonable to think that the number you see is the amount of power
your circuit is currently consuming, but it’s not always the case. Even
when some components are turned off and not consuming power, they can
still add to a battery's Active Usage. In this next picture, even though
the Auto Turret is not consuming power, it is still adding to the
battery’s

![](images/turned-off-usage.png)

Active Usage and in fact, it will actually consume 14 power. In this
case even though the AND Switch is not allowing power to pass through,
it does not have the ability to hide the Active Usage from inactive
components downstream or past it. In this next picture, if we use
different components to achieve the same outcome, we can hide

![](images/hide-active-usage.png)

the Auto Turret’s Active Usage from the battery when it is not consuming
power. This setup reduces the Active Usage all the way to 6. When
active, we will get an Active Usage of 16
but it will actually consume 18.  
Components like Switches, the Blocker, Timer and RF Transmitter all
have the ability to hide a component's Active Usage from batteries when
not passing power through.

Every component will only register an Active Usage once and equal to the
amount of power it consumes with the exception of the Electrical Branch.
Only the Branch Out value will register Active Usage even though it does
consume 1 power for itself. An Electrical Branch set to 2 will register
an Active Usage of 2 but will consume 3. Branch Out is a FIXED value.
The thing to remember is that it is the Branch Out value that is
registering Active Usage, not the components connected to Branch Out.
This means that the components connected to Branch Out, even though it
is where they are getting their power from, their Active Usage is not
what is registering on the battery. If there is another path that lets
the battery see these components, it is possible for their Active Usage
to register on the battery along with the Branch Out value, effectively
doubling the power needed. This next picture is a quick example to show
how a Boom Box that is powered from Branch Out, but using a Switch to
Toggle Play on and off, is registering 10 Active Usage for the Branch
Out, 1 for the Switch and 10 for the Boom Box. If we do the same thing,
but with the Splitter, we dont have this issue because the Splitter
controls its power flow DYNAMICALLY.
![](images/branch-vs-splitter-active-usage-onoff.png)

This is helpful in situations where you have a few small 
circuits where you dont want to force an Active Usage when the circuits
are off. Now because the Electrical Branch only registers the Branch Out
value as Active Usage and 0 for itself, we can trick batteries into
thinking less power is being consumed. In the next picture, we have some
examples using Auto Turrets.
![](images/active-usage-vs-pwr-consuption-turret.png)

Above, we have 1 example using 8 Electrical Branches to power 9 Auto
Turrets. Every branch is outputting 10 power but also consuming 1 power
for itself. So in total we are consuming 98 power but the battery’s
Active Usage is only 90. The 2nd example we are using 4 Splitters to
power the same number of turrets only this time the Splitters are
consuming 1 and have an Active Usage of 1 each. This gives us an Active
Usage and Power Consumption of 94. The example with Electrical Branches
only has 2 extra power meaning there is enough power available to add a
single Ceiling Light while the 2nd example has 6 extra power, that’s
enough power for 3 Ceiling Lights.

In the situation where an Inline Battery is being used, you want to
minimize the battery's Active Usage to minimize the cost of power
production. Like in the single Auto Turret examples above, there is a
required input power difference of 9rW just to maintain the battery.
Batteries are 80% efficient. Take the Active Usage number and divide it
by 0.8. This will give you the minimum amount of power required to
maintain the battery and it will not drain. It wont charge either. The
more power above the minimum, the faster the battery will charge but the
more you will waste when the battery is full. 1rW will charge a large
battery but it will take 34 IRL days.

In a bypass system like the Nih Core, Active Usage doesn't matter
because you are not relying on the battery as a main power source. You
are bypassing the battery. This means that the amount of power consumed
is more important. If we look at the above picture again with the 9 Auto
Turrets, we can see that while both examples are accomplishing the same
goal, 1 is consuming less power then the other. If we look back at the
single Auto Turret examples, the 1st example with an Active Usage of 13
will actually consume 14 vs the 2nd with an Active Usage of 6 will
actually consume 18. So while the 1st example is bad on an Inline
system, it is better in a bypass system. The less power you can use to
do something, gives you more power to do other things.

You can use a bypass system with 1 Large Battery and only use 50 power
to double the life of the battery but, it is more common to see a bypass
system used for 2 or more batteries to get a larger output. If we are
using 2 or more batteries to get the higher output, a Root Combiner will
be used. The moment we combine batteries to power a circuit that uses
more than 100 power, both batteries will have an Active Usage of 100.
This is because load sharing is not a thing in Rustricity. If the
circuit only needs 50, both batteries will have an Active Usage of
50(plus 1 for the Root Combiner).

![](images/root-combined-batterys.png)

Due to this being the way it is, if you combine 2 batteries to get 200
power, try to use all 200 because no matter if the circuit needs 101 or
199, 2 large batteries will only last 4 hours. If they are only going to
last 4 hours regardless, try to use as much of that 200 as possible to
make it worth combining the batteries. Otherwise, split the circuit, run
Inlines and minimize the Active Usage.

Now, having said you want to consume as little power as possible to
achieve the desired outcome when using a bypass battery backup, there
are times when it is worth consuming more for a bit of added security.
In the next picture, Ive used medium batteries for the demonstration,
and they are root combined powering some Auto Turrets.

![](images/power-bus-security-compared-turrets.png)

The top groups are using Electrical Branches. They are consuming more
power but in the event 1 battery is destroyed, top right, some turrets
stay active. The bottom groups use Splitters. While they do consume less
power, in the event a battery is lost, very bottom, all the turrets go
offline. You will need to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is
right to fit your needs. Read more in What is a Power Bus? 

# Parallel vs Series
Lets start by learning what Parallel and Series means in real life. Connecting batteries in series increases voltage and connecting batteries in parallel increases capacity.   

V = Volts (power)  
Ah = Amp hour (capacity)  

If we wire two 6V@10Ah batteries in parallel, we will still only have 6V but have 20Ah of capacity.  
If we wire two 6V@10Ah batteries in series, we will now have twice the power at 12V but with only 10Ah of capacity.  

![](images/paravssers.png)

In real life, batteries have positive (+) and negative (-) connections. In Rust, our batteries only have 1 input and 1 output. We also measure our Volts (V) as Rust Watts (rW) and our capacity, instead of Amp hours (Ah) we use Rust Watt Minutes (rWm).

In Rust, a large battery can give 100rW of power and has a capacity of 24000rWm. The outcome of wiring 2 large batteries in series would be 200rW of power with a capacity of 24000rWm. The outcome of wiring 2 large batteries in parallel would be 100rW of power with a capacity of 48000rWm.

## Series

To wire large batteries in series in Rust, just use a Root Combiner. The output will be 200rW and because both batteries will drain at the same, the total capacity will remain at 24000rWm. This will give a mimimum runtime of 4 hours.

![](images/series1.png)

Wiring more than 2 batteries into series is not much more complicated. Just add more Root Combiners. This will provide more power for consumption but the capacity will remain the same. For more information as to why the capacity stays the same, it is recommended reading [ Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumption ](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed) in the Power Storage section under Concepts. 

![](images/series2.png)

It is recommended to charge all the batteries wired in series at the same rate. This will help keep power levels equal across all batteries. For example, if there are 2 batteries in series and 1 of them drains empty, 50% of the circuit will go offline because 50% of the power is gone. However, giving priority to 1 battery in series could be a design feature.

## Parallel

To wire 2 large batteries in parallel requires a few more components. 1 battery needs to block the other battery to prevent both from draining at the same time. The output is only 95rW because of the extra components but the capacity will be doubled to 48000rWm. This would provide a minimum runtime of 8 hours.

![](images/parallel.png)

While this technically works for paralleling 2 batteries, consider using a secondary backup instead. 2 parallel batteries costs 5rW but a bypass secondary backup could cost as little as 2rW. This can also be true no matter the number of secondary batteries if there is no built in recharging. If recharging a secondary battery is built in, it adds a minimum of 2rW per battery to the power cost. Check out the section for [Secondary Backups](powerstorage.html#secondary-battery-backup) in Power Storage under Concepts.

Going beyond 2 batteries and tripling the capacity, things get a little more complicated.

# Nih Capacitor

**( will probably be fixed soon and wont work anymore )**

The Nih Capacitor was first established by Nih, with assistance from SwiftCoyote, on September 11, 2022.
A Capacitor is a set of components that accumulate power, much like rechargeable batteries.
However, the method for assessing the amount of stored power differs. 

![](images/batteryui2.png)

For batteries, the stored power is represented as `Capacity`,  
measured in Rust Watt Minutes (rWm).

Contrarily, in a Capacitor, we gauge the power storage by examining an Input/Output (IO) connection
and observing a figure that is typically associated with `power` or the amount of power available for use.  
But within the Capacitor, this figure **DOES NOT indicate the amount of power that can be utilized**.
Rather, this figure is what we call `Wire Capacity`, symbolized as `Np`.
For instance, in the image below, the displayed `6,492,076` is **NOT** the amount of power available.
Instead, it represents `6,492,076Np` of Wire Capacity. 

![](images/capacitor2.png)

Before going into the construction and operation of a Capacitor,
it’s essential to understand the math conversions between Rust Watt Minutes (rWm) and Wire Capacity (Np).  

Both represent capacity, but they use different units of measurement depending on the energy storage container, be it a battery or a capacitor. 

**The Maths:**  
`rWm :` rust watt minutes (capacity)  
`rW :` rust watts (commonly referred to as "power")  
`Np :` Wire Capacity  
`∅ :` 7.5 (Trust Me Bro)  
`S :` Seconds  
`τ :` 60 (The number of seconds in a minute, and minutes in an hour)  
`M :` Minutes  
`P :` Max power output for 1 second  
`O :` The amount of power you want to output  
`H :` Hours  


To convert rWm into Wire Capacity(Np), use the following equation:  
`(rWm × τ = P) × ∅ = Np`

To convert Wire Capacity(Np) into rWm, use the following equation:  
`(Np ÷ ∅ = P) ÷ τ = rWm`

To figure out how much time a given capacity will run for outputting a specific amount of power, use the following equations:  
`Seconds: (rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S`  
`Minutes: rWm ÷ O = M`  
`Hours: (rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H`  

**Examples**  
Using Capacity from the battery in the first picture, it is possible to figure out the number that would be seen if looking at an IO connection in a Capacitor to view Wire Capacity(Np).  
`(rWm × τ = P) × ∅ = Np`  
`(271 × 60 = 16,260) × 7.5 = 121,950Np`  

Therefore a capacity of 271rWm when viewed on an IO connection is equal to 121,950Np.
We can also see that if the Large Battery did not have an output limit of 100,
it would be able to output 16,260rW of power for 1 second. 

Using the IO connection to view Wire Capacity(Np) from the second picture,
it is possible to figure out how much rWm of Capacity we would have if this was viewed on a battery.  
`(Np ÷ ∅ = P) ÷ τ = rWm`  
`(6,492,076 ÷ 7.5 = 865,610.1333) ÷ 60 = 14,426rWm`  

Therefore a Wire Capacity of 6,492,076Np when viewed on a battery represented as Capacity, it is equal to 14,426rWm.  

Without a limited output, the Capacitor is capable of delivering 865,610rW of power for 1 second. 

Using both of these examples, it's possible to calculate the length of time both the Battery and Capacitor would power a circuit for,
given a set output.
> For our example, let's say the circuit needs 100 power.  

Battery :  
  `(rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S`  
  `(271 ÷ 100 = 2.71 Minutes) × 60 = 162 Seconds`  

Capacitor : *(you will need to convert from Np to rWm first)*  
  `(rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S`  
  `(14,426 ÷ 100 = 144.26 Minutes) × 60 = 8,655 Seconds`  

OR :  
  `(rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H`  
  `(14,426 ÷ 100 = 144.26 Minutes) ÷ 60 = 2.40 Hours`  

Prior to constructing a capacitor, it’s crucial to understand its limitations and potential issues.
This will clarify misconceptions such as the notion of ‘infinite power’ and help identify the appropriate contexts for its use.  

- It doesn’t survive server restarts. evrytime the server restarts, all of the stored power will vanish, poof gone.  
- When automating energy extraction, it is possible that a flicker will be created or worse, all the power vanishes, poof gone.
- It consumes power even when nothing is connected to it, unlike a battery that doesn’t lose power if nothing is connected to it.
- It is not portable.

Now, some of the advantages and benefits of the Capacitor

# What is a Power Bus?

![](images/image127.png)

Power always needs a way to get from point A to point B. That could be from a Wind Turbine to an Auto Turret or from a Solar Panel to a Light. A power bus is a single or group of components with the sole purpose of directing the flow of electricity to different circuits that perform specific tasks such as auto turrets or lighting. This is a lot like the breaker panel or fuse panel you have in your home for your electricity. Each breaker or fuse is dedicated for a specific room or purpose, like the fridge, furnace, bedrooms or garage. These breakers or fuses limit how much power each circuit can use and in Rust, this is no different. Instead of breakers or fuses, its Electrical Branches and Splitters.

 The most difficult part of deciding how to distribute power is knowing how the components that are specifically made for this job function. There are 2 main components, the Electrical Branch and the Splitter and its recommended reading about them specifically in the Power Distribution section under Component Details. There are 3 types of power buses, fixed, dynamic and configurable. 


---

## Fixed Bus (F-Bus)

![](images/image115.png)

A fixed bus, known as an F-Bus, is when you dedicate a specific amount of power per output. This can be just a single Electrical Branch or a group of them. This type of power bus always consumes the amount of power each output is set to, even if nothing is attached to Branch Out. This will affect Inline battery backups by forcing an Active Usage and it will affect a bypass battery backup by always consuming power, even when the components connected to Branch Out are offline. 

A fixed bus is an easy way to build in priorities and a bit of security. The first Electrical Branch has the highest priority because it's the first to get power and in the event that power levels start falling, it will be the last branch to lose power. The security comes from knowing that if 50% of the power supply disappears, only some branches will lose power and not all. 


---

## Dynamic Bus (D-Bus)

![](images/image51.png)

A dynamic bus, known as a D-Bus, is when the components evenly distribute power between all connected outputs. This can be just a single Splitter or a group of them and the only control over the amount of power available at each output is the amount of power that is put into it. 

This is great when the component or circuit attached to each output requires the same amount of power. It is a power efficient way to supply the same amount of power to multiple components or circuits. When using a bypass battery backup, it can free up some power to be used somewhere else. When using an Inline battery backup, only the Active Usage from the Splitter is forced onto the battery. Only when the components connected to each output are online will their Active Usage be reflected on the battery. This is good in situations where a player wants to use a Switch to turn things off before they logout. 

If an output gets destroyed, the system will evenly redistribute power between the remaining outputs. The drawback would be that if the incoming power drops too low to support the connected outputs, everything will stop working or at least those that require the full amount of power that was previously present.

## Configure Siphon

![](images/multi-c-bus.png)

A configure siphon, known as a C-Bus, is a bypass distributor that is only active when required. The idea is only when power is needed will the C-Bus become active, otherwise the power just passes through. Set the Electrical Branches in the siphon to a specific amount of power to only be used when the siphon is active. There are multiple versions of the siphon based on if there is a need for manual or automatic operation and what kind of battery backup is being used. 

All of them are centered around the Memory Cell. The Memory Cell has 2 outputs, Output and Inverted Output. One output is called the Main Line (aka the bypass) and the other output goes to the Circuit that we want to power. The Main Line is the default path the electricity takes when the siphon is not active. It will pass from a Memory Cell to an OR Switch and out. The Circuit path is the route electricity will take when the Memory Cell gets triggered. It gets sent to an Electrical Branch that is configured to an amount of power the circuit needs while the remainder gets sent off to the OR Switch and back onto the Main Line to continue powering the circuits past it. While this is the general concept, let's get a little more specific.

There are **2 categories** of Configure Siphons. There is the **Auto Reset** which will automatically turn itself on when an input is received and off when the input signal is removed. The second is **Manual** which requires a player to manually turn it on and off. Within each of these categories there are **2 types**. There is the **Standard C-Bus** which is to be used in a circuit that uses a bypass battery backup like the [Nih Core](powerstorage.html#nih-core). The second type is the Blocked C-Bus meant to be used in a circuit that uses an [Inline](powerstorage.html#nih-core) battery backup. The reason 1 has a Blocker is because of the nature of components and a battery's Active Usage. The Blocker has the ability to hide Active Usage from a battery when it is actively being blocked. Read more about that in the section titled [ Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumption ](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed) located in Power Storage under Concepts.

Now to get very specific. Starting with the Auto Reset siphons, these by default will send power out the Inverted Output(left output). Power will be passed to an OR Switch then out. In the Blocked version, power gets passed to an Electrical Branch that is used to block a Blocker before passing power to the OR Switch and out. ‘Out’ could be another siphon, another type of power bus or whatever. A HBHF Sensor is used as the input source but it doesn’t have to be. All that’s needed is a constant source of power to keep the siphon active. When the sensor outputs power, it will ‘SET’ the Memory Cell. This will force the Memory Cell to flip outputs and send power through Output(right output). From Output, power will be sent to an Electrical Branch configured to +2 over the amount of power your circuit will need. The leftover power will pass through Power Out and merge back into the Main Line. The power coming out of Branch Out will go to another Electrical Branch that will be set to the amount of power the circuit actually needs. The reason for +2 is because 1rW is needed for the second Electrical Branch itself and 1rW needs to be sent out Power Out to ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell. In the blocked version, a Blocker was added before the first Electrical Branch so it can hide the Active Usage caused by the Electrical Branches from a battery. When the sensor stops sending power to ‘SET’, the power going to ‘RESET’ will force the Memory Cell to flip outputs back to Inverted Output and return power to the Main Line. In the blocked version, because of the Electrical Branch on the Main Line, the Blocker will get blocked again to hide the Active Usage.

The Manual siphons function in a very similar way only instead of using ‘SET’ or ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell, ‘TOGGLE’ is used instead. Everytime ‘TOGGLE’ receives power, the Memory Cell will flip outputs. A Red Button is used in the pictured examples but it doesn't have to be. When it comes to which output on the Memory Cell is the Main Line or the Circuit line, it really doesn't matter because there is the ability to manually control which output power is actively passing through. 

In all the examples we have used Counters at each output. This is
only to show how much power each C-Bus costs to not be active.
[Here is a Rustrician BP link to explore the C-Bus more. ](https://www.rustrician.io/?circuit%3D71c12c6e40d98dea32fb463a773b2f42)

# Short Circuit / Max Depth

This is a single message that is displayed for 2 different errors. At
the time of creating this section, XOR Switches did not consume any
power which is why you will see them used in the pictures. The pictures
might get remade in time but power consumption is not important when
discussing and understanding this error.

## Short Circuit

A short circuit happens when you have power feeding back into itself,
AKA, a loop.  

![](images/image124.png)

Why would you do this? You wouldn’t. In the past, batteries functioned
differently and there was a need to create the “Infinite Power Loop”.
Today, batteries have something called “[Active Usage](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed)”. This breaks the
infinite loop and eliminates a need for it to exist.

You can circumvent a short circuit by increasing the number of
components in the loop to be 9 or greater.

![](images/image10.png)

In the next picture we show a battery feeding power back into
itself.

![](images/image62.png)

There is no reason to do this anymore. There was a time when batteries
could only exist in 1 state at a time. They were either charging or
discharging and when they were discharging, they were always doing it at
their max. Back then, people found a way to use the extra power and send
it back to the battery. For example, a large battery was always
outputting 100 power whereas today, they calculate an [Active Usage](powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed) and
only drain the amount of power a circuit needs, up to 100. Today, if the
circuit only needs 50, the battery only gives 50.

The other thing to note is batteries also cause an active usage. For a
large battery, it is 400, so in the above loop, you are forcing a max
drain on the battery. There is no advantage to this.

---

## Max Depth

Maximum Depth is referring to the number of components between your
power source and the  Root Combiner. A Max Depth error will occur when
we exceed 16 components.

![](images/image101.png)

It is important to understand this mechanic and how to calculate it.
This becomes important when combining multiple power sources including a
battery backup with multiple combined batteries. If you experience this
error, to calculate the depth of a circuit, we start with the last Root
Combiner or the combiner that is furthest away from the power source and
count the number of components power must pass through all the way back
to the power source. This limits where in a circuit you can use Root
Combiners.

The below images are 2 ways root combiners can be stacked. The group on
the left is known as pyramid stacking and the group on the right is
known as a daisy chain. While both groups are possible, you can see that
the group on the left is only 4 components deep whereas the right side
is 8 deep. This is important when working with a large amount of
centralized power because you can quickly use up the depth and then not
be able to have the number of batteries you want or need.

![](images/image7.png)

In this next image, we have 8 Windmills combined into a Nih Core with a
battery backup containing 6 Large Batteries. This circuit has a total
depth of 13 components. The trick to counting depth is counting the
components in the longest route from the last Root Combiner, **#1** back to
the Windmill, **#13**.  

![](images/image99.png)

In the next example, we have 2 isolated power sources. The first source
is the cluster of Windmills. The second is the combined Solar Panels for
the Component Destruction Detector. This means that we have 2 paths we
must consider when calculating the depth. The first path to look at is
the one that goes from the Root Combiner **#1** back to the Windmill **#14**.
This path is the main power path. The second path goes from Root
Combiner **#1** back to the Solar Panel **#16**. If one of these paths exceed
the Max Depth limit of 16 components, you will start to see the error
message at Root Combiner **#1**.

![](images/image50.png)

The next image shows a Max Depth using an equal number of Windmills and
Batteries with a Nih Core.

# Circuit Delay and Power Flow

## Circuit Delay

Circuit Delay at its most basic, is the amount of time it takes power to pass from one component to another. The amount of time we are talking about is incredibly small but a lot of small increases will eventually become a large amount of time. One way to test how fast rustricity is on any server is by stringing a bunch of lights together, the more the better, and watch how long it takes for all of them to turn on and off. For this reason, it is impossible to say the specific amount of time it takes for components to react but some do react slower or faster than others. 

All components that only have a power input and a passthrough power output, will react at or around the same speed. These would be components like lights. From the moment the light receives power to the moment it sends power out, we will call this 1 unit of time. If power passes through 2 lights, from the moment the first light receives power to the moment the second light sends power out, we can call this 2 units of time. The time it takes to pass through 3 lights, we call 3 units of time.  

Components with multiple outputs have their own delay, 1 for each output. For example, the Splitter, it has 3 outputs. Power is sent out 1 output at a time. The amount of time from the moment the Splitter receives power to the time the last output sends power out is equal to 1 unit of time. The Electrical Branch sends power through Power Out first then Branch Out and this is equal to 2 units of time. On the Memory Cell, it needs 3 units of time to flip outputs.

Batteries also have their own delay. When a battery has an Active Usage of 0, it enters an ‘Off’ state. When the time comes for the battery to power something, it must enter an ‘On’ state which has a delay equal to 2 units of time. Keeping the battery in the ‘On’ state with a Root Combiner or an Industrial Light eliminates the delay so you have power right away. 

## Power Flow

Power Flow is the path electricity takes through a circuit and the order of the path, aka the order of operation. We need to remember that Rustricity is nothing more than lines of code that are processed 1 after another. Not only does this create a Circuit Delay, as explained above, it also only allows 1 component at a time to perform an action. This creates the order of operation.  

Using the picture below to help illustrate, when we flip on the Switch, light 1 will power on followed by light 2 then light 3 and finally light 4. When we flip the Switch off, light 1 will power offfollowed by light 2 then light 3 and finally light 4. Power flow gets alittle more complicated when we introduce components with multipleoutputs.  

![](images/passtrough-chain.png)

Starting with the Electrical Branch that has 2 outputs, power
is first sent through Power Out then power gets sent through Branch Out.
When it is removed, it will first be removed from Power Out then Branch Out.

![](images/branch-outputs.png)

The Splitter is similar but it has 3 outputs. Power first goes through Power Out 1
followed by Power Out 2 then Power Out 3. When power is removed,
it will be removed first from Power Out 1 followed by Power
Out 2 then Power Out 3.

![](images/splitter-out.png)

The Memory Cell is another component that has 2 outputs. Even though it only sends power through 1 output at a time, Output will always react before Inverted Output. This means that when we apply power to ‘Set’, power will be sent out the Output first before we lose power from the Inverted Output. When we apply power to ‘Reset’, we will first lose power from Output before power is sent out the Inverted Output. 

![](images/powerflowmemcell.png)  

Looking at these components at the individual level should be fairly easy to understand. When we combine components with multiple outputs, we will start to create a semi-predictable path. Using the below image, we know that the Electrical Branch will send power through Power Out first before sending power through Branch Out. It will do this before either Splitter attached to them will react. This gives us the following order of operation, 1 through 8.

![](images/powerflueebsplit.png)

The Memory Cell acts similarly to the Electrical Branch. 1 output will react before the other, the only difference is 1 output is losing power while the other is gaining power. Let's say we are going to flip power from the Inverted Output to the Output. 1- Output will send out power first. 2- Inverted Output will lose power next. 3, 4 and 5 will send out power one at a time in order, followed by 6, 7 and 8 losing power one at a time, in order. The order of operation is the exact same when flipping power back over to Inverted Output from Output.
 
 ![](images/powerflowmemsplit.png)

So far we have been talking about components sending power or losing power. There is another side to Power Flow and that is the order in which a component receives power. Some components require power first before getting toggled while with others, it doesn't matter what input gets power first, they will react once powered on. 

Let's start with components that will react no matter what input gets power first. 

`Memory Cell` - It doesn't matter if the side inputs or the main input gets power first. Once the main input receives power, it will put itself into the correct configuration based on what side inputs are receiving power.

![](images/memcellpwrflw.png)

`Counter` - Sending power to the side inputs, it will count up or down and clear with no power provided to the main input. Only once power is provided to the main input will the screen turn on to display the number. If the number shown is the same as the target number, power will be sent through. 

![](images/cntrpwrflw.png)

`RAND Switch` - Sending power to the side inputs will Set and Reset the RAND Switch with no power provided to the main input. Only once power is provided to the main input will power pass through or not depending on the state of the switch. The side inputs only react when they are provided with power. Having constant power on them when the main power is removed or received will not affect the switch and it will remain in the same state.

![](images/randpwrflw.png)

`Blocker` -  Sending power to the side input before sending power to the main input will block power from passing through. However, if you send power to the main input first and the very next operation, send power to the side input, it should still block power from passing through. If the delay between sending power to the main input then to the side input is long enough, power will get sent through before it gets blocked.

![](images/blckrpwrflw.png)

The following components require power to their main input first before sending power to their secondary inputs.

`Electric Furnace` - If you want to use the secondary inputs to turn the furnace on or off, you must send power to the main input first. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the main input receives power, the furnace will remain in whatever state it was in before the main input lost power. 

![](images/frncpwrflw.png)

`Conveyor` - If you want to use the secondary inputs to turn the conveyor on or off, you must send power to the main input first. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the main input receives power, the conveyor will remain in whatever state it was in before the main input lost power.

![](images/cnvyrpwrflw.png)

`Timer` - If you want to use the secondary input to toggle the timer on, you must first send power to the main input. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the main input receives power, the timer will not toggle on.

![](images/tmrpwrflw.png)

`Boom Box` -If you want to use the secondary input to toggle the boom box on to play music, you must first send power to the main input. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the main input receives power, the boom box will not toggle on and not play music.

![](images/mbmxpwrflw.png)

`Elevator` - If you want to use the secondary inputs to call the elevator to a floor, you must first send power to the main input. If you send power to the secondary inputs first, when the main input receives power, the elevator will not be called to a floor.

![](images/lvtrpwrflw.png)

We have covered how power flow is affected by components with multiple outputs. We have covered components that are affected by the order they receive power flow. The last piece of the puzzle is something I don't have enough information to properly explain atm. It appears that the game can prioritize some components over another. I hope to one day be able to explain this in detail but to help illustrate how a complex circuit behaves, I have broken down the Nih Core to show the order of operation.

![](images/nihcorepowbat2.png)

The left side shows the order of operation when switching from battery backup to windmill power.  

#### Main Power:  

1.  The amount of power coming into the Nih Core rises above 106.  
2.  Power is sent out Power Out to the next Electrical Branch.  
3.  Power coming out of Branch Out to the Memory Cell rises to its set amount.  
4.  Power is sent out Power Out to the OR Switch.  
5.  Power is sent out Branch Out to the Splitter.  
6.  Power is sent out to the Large Battery.  
7.  Power is sent out to Set on the Memory Cell.  
8.  Power is sent out the Memory Cells Output.  
9.  Power is sent out to Reset on the Memory Cell.  
10. Power is sent out to Block Passthrough on the Blocker.  
11. Power stops coming out of Inverted Output on the Memory Cell.  
12. Power stops coming out of Power Out on the Blocker.  
13. Power from the Memory Cells Output is now the power passing through the OR Switch.  
14. The battery enters its Off state.  

The right side is the order of operation when switching from windmill power on to battery backup.  

#### Battery Power:  

1.  The amount of power coming into the Nih Core drops below 106 triggering
    the flip but must drop below 101 for it to look like the example pictured.  
2.  Power stops coming out of Branch Out to the next Electrical Branch.  
3.  Power coming out of Branch Out to the Memory Cell drops below its set amount.  
4.  Power stops coming out of Power Out to the OR Switch.  
5.  Power stops coming out of Branch Out to the Splitter.  
6.  Power stops coming out of the OR Switch to the Large Battery.  
7.  Power stops going to Set on the Memory Cell.  
8.  Power stops coming out of the Memory Cells Output.  
9.  Power stops going to Reset on the Memory Cell.  
10. Power stops going to Block Passthrough on the Blocker.  
11. Power is sent out the Memory Cells Inverted Output.  
12. The battery enters its On state and sends power out to the Blocker.  
13. Power stops coming out of the OR Switch.  
14. Power is sent out the OR Switch to the Large Battery.  
15. Power is sent out the Blocker to the OR Switch.  
16. Power is sent out the OR Switch.  

That wraps up this section. I hope I have explained things in a way that makes sense. Please comment on the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing) if you have any suggestions or questions.

# Uncategorized Concepts

# Side Inputs
They are not bugged or broken, you just don't know how to use them yet.

It is not uncommon for people to think of ‘Switch On’ and ‘Switch Off’
as a toggle like on the side of a Timer. They are not toggles, they are
inputs with an added function. Just like the ‘Power In’ on the bottom,
the side inputs also pass power through to the top. The function part
only functions when power is received, removed or the amount of power is
updated.

When ANY input on the Switch receives an "update", the Switch will bind
to that input for its source of power that passes through to the top. It
will remain bound to that input until another input "updates" which will
force the switch to bind to the new input. An update is either losing
power or receiving power, 0-1 or 1-0 or power levels change up or down.

The exception to this is when one input is receiving an amount of power
and another input receives the same amount of power, the Switch will not
recognize the new source and remain bound to the original input.

The following pictures will help illustrate how it works.

Starting off, we are using 3 Switches to provide 3 different amounts of
power each input. Green wire is for Switch On. Red wire is for Switch
Off. Black wire is for Electric Input on the bottom. Yellow lines mark
the path power is taking. Red lines mark where power stops. In this
first picture, we are sending power to the bottom input and the Switch
sends it out the top, with the expected power loss.

Next, we leave power going into the bottom and then apply power to
Switch Off. As we can see, the Switch will flip
off.

![](images/image41.png)

![](images/image13.png)

If we manually flip the Switch back on, we can now see a new amount of
power displaying on the counter.

![](images/image75.png)

This is because the Switch is now bound to the Switch Off input for the
power that passes through to the top. The power going into the bottom
input is completely ignored. For the next picture, we flip the Switch
back off and then apply power to Switch On.

![](images/image64.png)

The Switch will now flip on and once again pass through a new amount of
power to the counter. The power going to the bottom input or Switch Off
input is now ignored and the Switch is bound to Switch On. In the next
picture, we remove power from Switch On while keeping power applied to
Switch Off and the bottom.

![](images/image30.png)

We can see here now that power was removed from Switch On, the Switch
has no power. The green light turns off and the Switch is still in the
on position. Even though the other 2 inputs have power, the Switch is
bound to Switch On for its source of power, which was removed. If we
restore power to Switch On, the Switch will start passing power though
again like the previous picture. With power restored, for the next
picture we will remove power from Switch Off.

![](images/image44.png)

We restored power to Switch On before removing power from Switch Off.
The green light turns off when power is removed and the Switch binds to
the Switch Off. This is because that input received an update from
‘having power’ to ‘not having power’, from 1 to 0. For the next picture,
we restore power to Switch Off.

![](images/image53.png)

Restoring power to the Switch Off input, the red light turns on and the
Switch flips to the off position. When we manually flip it on we can see
the new amount of power passing through.

![](images/image105.png)

Seeing that we only have 28 power showing on the counter, it is clear
power is coming through the Switch Off input. When we remove power from
the bottom input, the Switch loses power.

![](images/image73.png)

It loses power because the bottom input was updated, from 1 to 0, so the
Switch bound to it. Now bound to the bottom input and not receiving
power, the green light turns off and no power passes through. Restoring
power to the bottom input, the green light turns back on and the new
power amount is displayed on the counter.

![](images/image126.png)

Seeing the power level on the counter confirming power is coming into
the bottom, we will now adjust the Electrical Branch to send more power
to Switch On.

![](images/image116.png)

After increasing the amount of power, we can see an instant change on
the counter to reflect that the Switch changed the input it was bound to
from the bottom input to Switch On.

In conclusion, whichever is the last input to receive an update is the
input the Switch will bind to for its source of power. Adding power,
removing power or a change in power levels will update the Switches
input. When moving power from one input to another, it is important
