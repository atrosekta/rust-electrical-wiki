Where To Find              | Requires a Steam item purchased from the market
Inputs/Outputs             | Turn On, Toggle, Turn Off
Active Usage               | 1
Power Consumption          | 1rW per input but none for itself
Low Grade Fuel Capacity    | 500
Low Grade Fuel Consumption | 1/min when active or 10/min when set to Motion
Despawn Time               | 5 minutes
Decay Time                 | 96 hours

Notes:

- This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
  Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.
- When Active, it creates a fog cloud in front of it that covers an area
  equal to a 2x2 and is thickest below half height walls. Consumes low
  grade fuel at 1 per minute.
- When set to Motion, it only gets set off by non authorized players and
  will emit fog every couple seconds creating a thicker cloud directly
  in front of it. Setting the fogger at a half wall height, the constant
  emission of the fogger creates a thick cloud at eye level. Consumes
  low grade fuel at 10 per minute.
- The fogger only emits a cloud as long as the non authorized player is
  moving. If the player stops moving, the fogger turns off.
- A cloud takes 5 seconds to form and 40 seconds to disappear.
- Increasing the number of foggers increases the density of the cloud. 4
  foggers is enough to block the light from fire and 5 will block light
  from electrical lighting.
- Fog will fall toward the ground and accumulate on any horizontal
  surface. The higher the fogger the thinner the cloud.
- Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
  hold Use(`E`) to Activate, Open or turn on Motion.
- Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that dictates the state of the fogger. For example, if  constant power is sent to TURN ON, the fogger turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF, the fogger will not turn back on, even with power still going to TURN ON. Power will need to be removed and reapplied to TURN ON for the fogger to turn back on.
- The TOGGLE input will turn the fogger on when it receives power and turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet point. If power is applied to TOGGLE, the fogger will turn on. While the fogger is on, if power is sent to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE, the fogger will not turn back on. On the other hand if power is sent to TURN ON, the fogger will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the fogger will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, when power is removed from TOGGLE, the fogger will turn off. This is because when power is removed from TOGGLE, it tells the fogger to turn off.
- They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the ground.
- Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp.

- This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
  Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.
- When Active, it creates a patch of snow in front of the machine with a
  radius of 3.5 square foundations.
- The snow pile takes 1 second to form and 2 minutes 45 seconds to
  disappear.
- The snow at its deepest goes halfway up a character's chin.
- Increasing the number of machines does not increase the depth of the
  snow.
- Snowfall is 3.5 floors high.
- Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
  hold Use(`E`) to Activate, Open or Stop.
- The TOGGLE input will turn the machine on when it receives power and
  turn off when power is removed. When TURN ON receives power, the
  machine will turn on and stay on when TURN ON loses power. When TURN
  OFF receives power, it will always turn the machine off. If power is
  currently going to TURN OFF, sending power to the other inputs will
  turn the machine on.
