# Strobe Light![](images/image102.png)

| | |  
|-|---|  
Item ID           |  2104517339
Description       | A flashing light with 3 speeds
Crafting Recipe   | 2 High Quality Metal, 100 Metal Fragments

Inputs/Outputs    | Toggle, Turn On, Turn Off
Active Usage      | 1
Power Consumption | 1rW per input but none for itself
Despawn Time      | 5 minutes

Notes:

- This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
  Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.
- Requires TC authorization to change strobe settings. Look at the light
  and hold USE(`E`) to change the frequency of the strobe between 10hz,
  20hz and 40hz or to manually turn it on.
- Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that dictates the state of the light. For example, if power is constantly sent to TURN ON, the light turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the light will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF, the light will not turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. Power will need to be removed then reapplied power to TURN ON for the light to turn back on.
- The TOGGLE input will turn the light on when it receives power and turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet point. If power is applied to TOGGLE, the light will turn on. While the light is on, if power is sent to TURN OFF, the light will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE, the light will not turn back on. On the other hand if power is sent to TURN ON, the light will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the light will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, if power is removed from TOGGLE and the light will turn off. This is because when power is removed from TOGGLE, it tells the light to turn off. 
- They take damage when active at a rate of **1hp/3min42sec**.
- They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the ground.
- Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp.
