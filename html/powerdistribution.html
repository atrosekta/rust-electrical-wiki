<h1 id="what-is-a-power-bus"><a href="#what-is-a-power-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>What is a Power Bus?</h1>
<p><img src="images/image127.png" /></p>
<p>Power always needs a way to get from point A to point B. That could
be from a Wind Turbine to an Auto Turret or from a Solar Panel to a
Light. A power bus is a single or group of components with the sole
purpose of directing the flow of electricity to different circuits that
perform specific tasks such as auto turrets or lighting. This is a lot
like the breaker panel or fuse panel you have in your home for your
electricity. Each breaker or fuse is dedicated for a specific room or
purpose, like the fridge, furnace, bedrooms or garage. These breakers or
fuses limit how much power each circuit can use and in Rust, this is no
different. Instead of breakers or fuses, its Electrical Branches and
Splitters.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of deciding how to distribute power is
knowing how the components that are specifically made for this job
function. There are 2 main components, the Electrical Branch and the
Splitter and its recommended reading about them specifically in the
Power Distribution section under Component Details. There are 3 types of
power buses, fixed, dynamic and configurable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fixed-bus-f-bus"><a href="#fixed-bus-f-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Fixed Bus (F-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image115.png" /></p>
<p>A fixed bus, known as an F-Bus, is when you dedicate a specific
amount of power per output. This can be just a single Electrical Branch
or a group of them. This type of power bus always consumes the amount of
power each output is set to, even if nothing is attached to Branch Out.
This will affect Inline battery backups by forcing an Active Usage and
it will affect a bypass battery backup by always consuming power, even
when the components connected to Branch Out are offline.</p>
<p>A fixed bus is an easy way to build in priorities and a bit of
security. The first Electrical Branch has the highest priority because
it’s the first to get power and in the event that power levels start
falling, it will be the last branch to lose power. The security comes
from knowing that if 50% of the power supply disappears, only some
branches will lose power and not all.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dynamic-bus-d-bus"><a href="#dynamic-bus-d-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Dynamic Bus (D-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image51.png" /></p>
<p>A dynamic bus, known as a D-Bus, is when the components evenly
distribute power between all connected outputs. This can be just a
single Splitter or a group of them and the only control over the amount
of power available at each output is the amount of power that is put
into it.</p>
<p>This is great when the component or circuit attached to each output
requires the same amount of power. It is a power efficient way to supply
the same amount of power to multiple components or circuits. When using
a bypass battery backup, it can free up some power to be used somewhere
else. When using an Inline battery backup, only the Active Usage from
the Splitter is forced onto the battery. Only when the components
connected to each output are online will their Active Usage be reflected
on the battery. This is good in situations where a player wants to use a
Switch to turn things off before they logout.</p>
<p>If an output gets destroyed, the system will evenly redistribute
power between the remaining outputs. The drawback would be that if the
incoming power drops too low to support the connected outputs,
everything will stop working or at least those that require the full
amount of power that was previously present.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="configure-siphon-c-bus"><a href="#configure-siphon-c-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Configure Siphon (C-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/multi-c-bus.png" /></p>
<p>A configure siphon, known as a C-Bus, is a bypass distributor that is
only active when required. The idea is only when power is needed will
the C-Bus become active, otherwise the power just passes through. Set
the Electrical Branches in the siphon to a specific amount of power to
only be used when the siphon is active. There are multiple versions of
the siphon based on if there is a need for manual or automatic operation
and what kind of battery backup is being used.</p>
<p>All of them are centered around the Memory Cell. The Memory Cell has
2 outputs, Output and Inverted Output. One output is called the Main
Line (aka the bypass) and the other output goes to the Circuit that we
want to power. The Main Line is the default path the electricity takes
when the siphon is not active. It will pass from a Memory Cell to an OR
Switch and out. The Circuit path is the route electricity will take when
the Memory Cell gets triggered. It gets sent to an Electrical Branch
that is configured to an amount of power the circuit needs while the
remainder gets sent off to the OR Switch and back onto the Main Line to
continue powering the circuits past it. While this is the general
concept, let’s get a little more specific.</p>
<p>There are <strong>2 categories</strong> of Configure Siphons. There
is the <strong>Auto Reset</strong> which will automatically turn itself
on when an input is received and off when the input signal is removed.
The second is <strong>Manual</strong> which requires a player to
manually turn it on and off. Within each of these categories there are
<strong>2 types</strong>. There is the <strong>Standard C-Bus</strong>
which is to be used in a circuit that uses a bypass battery backup like
the <a href="powerstorage.html#nih-core">Nih Core</a>. The second type
is the Blocked C-Bus meant to be used in a circuit that uses an <a
href="powerstorage.html#nih-core">Inline</a> battery backup. The reason
1 has a Blocker is because of the nature of components and a battery’s
Active Usage. The Blocker has the ability to hide Active Usage from a
battery when it is actively being blocked. Read more about that in the
section titled <a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Battery
Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumption</a> located in Power Storage
under Concepts.</p>
<p>Now to get very specific. Starting with the Auto Reset siphons, these
by default will send power out the Inverted Output(left output). Power
will be passed to an OR Switch then out. In the Blocked version, power
gets passed to an Electrical Branch that is used to block a Blocker
before passing power to the OR Switch and out. ‘Out’ could be another
siphon, another type of power bus or whatever. A HBHF Sensor is used as
the input source but it doesn’t have to be. All that’s needed is a
constant source of power to keep the siphon active. When the sensor
outputs power, it will ‘SET’ the Memory Cell. This will force the Memory
Cell to flip outputs and send power through Output(right output). From
Output, power will be sent to an Electrical Branch configured to +2 over
the amount of power your circuit will need. The leftover power will pass
through Power Out and merge back into the Main Line. The power coming
out of Branch Out will go to another Electrical Branch that will be set
to the amount of power the circuit actually needs. The reason for +2 is
because 1rW is needed for the second Electrical Branch itself and 1rW
needs to be sent out Power Out to ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell. In the
blocked version, a Blocker was added before the first Electrical Branch
so it can hide the Active Usage caused by the Electrical Branches from a
battery. When the sensor stops sending power to ‘SET’, the power going
to ‘RESET’ will force the Memory Cell to flip outputs back to Inverted
Output and return power to the Main Line. In the blocked version,
because of the Electrical Branch on the Main Line, the Blocker will get
blocked again to hide the Active Usage.</p>
<p>The Manual siphons function in a very similar way only instead of
using ‘SET’ or ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell, ‘TOGGLE’ is used instead.
Everytime ‘TOGGLE’ receives power, the Memory Cell will flip outputs. A
Red Button is used in the pictured examples but it doesn’t have to be.
When it comes to which output on the Memory Cell is the Main Line or the
Circuit line, it really doesn’t matter because there is the ability to
manually control which output power is actively passing through.</p>
<p>In all the examples we have used Counters at each output. This is
only to show how much power each C-Bus costs to not be active. <a

<h1 id="short-circuit-max-depth"><a href="#short-circuit-max-depth"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit / Max Depth</h1>
<p>This is a single message that is displayed for 2 different errors. At
the time of creating this section, XOR Switches did not consume any
power which is why you will see them used in the pictures. The pictures
might get remade in time but power consumption is not important when
discussing and understanding this error.</p>
<h2 id="short-circuit"><a href="#short-circuit"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit</h2>
<p>A short circuit happens when you have power feeding back into itself,
AKA, a loop.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image124.png" /></p>
<p>Why would you do this? You wouldn’t. In the past, batteries
functioned differently and there was a need to create the “Infinite
Power Loop”. Today, batteries have something called “<a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Active
Usage</a>”. This breaks the infinite loop and eliminates a need for it
to exist.</p>
<p>You can circumvent a short circuit by increasing the number of
components in the loop to be 9 or greater.</p>
<p><img src="images/image10.png" /></p>
<p>In the next picture we show a battery feeding power back into
itself.</p>
<p><img src="images/image62.png" /></p>
<p>There is no reason to do this anymore. There was a time when
batteries could only exist in 1 state at a time. They were either
charging or discharging and when they were discharging, they were always
doing it at their max. Back then, people found a way to use the extra
power and send it back to the battery. For example, a large battery was
always outputting 100 power whereas today, they calculate an <a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Active
Usage</a> and only drain the amount of power a circuit needs, up to 100.
Today, if the circuit only needs 50, the battery only gives 50.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is batteries also cause an active usage. For
a large battery, it is 400, so in the above loop, you are forcing a max
drain on the battery. There is no advantage to this.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="max-depth"><a href="#max-depth" class="anchor-link">*</a>Max
Depth</h2>
<p>Maximum Depth is referring to the number of components between your
power source and the  Root Combiner. A Max Depth error will occur when
we exceed 16 components.</p>
<p><img src="images/image101.png" /></p>
<p>It is important to understand this mechanic and how to calculate it.
This becomes important when combining multiple power sources including a
battery backup with multiple combined batteries. If you experience this
error, to calculate the depth of a circuit, we start with the last Root
Combiner or the combiner that is furthest away from the power source and
count the number of components power must pass through all the way back
to the power source. This limits where in a circuit you can use Root
Combiners.</p>
<p>The below images are 2 ways root combiners can be stacked. The group
on the left is known as pyramid stacking and the group on the right is
known as a daisy chain. While both groups are possible, you can see that
the group on the left is only 4 components deep whereas the right side
is 8 deep. This is important when working with a large amount of
centralized power because you can quickly use up the depth and then not
be able to have the number of batteries you want or need.</p>
<p><img src="images/image7.png" /></p>
<p>In this next image, we have 8 Windmills combined into a Nih Core with
a battery backup containing 6 Large Batteries. This circuit has a total
depth of 13 components. The trick to counting depth is counting the
components in the longest route from the last Root Combiner,
<strong>#1</strong> back to the Windmill, <strong>#13</strong>.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image99.png" /></p>
<p>In the next example, we have 2 isolated power sources. The first
source is the cluster of Windmills. The second is the combined Solar
Panels for the Component Destruction Detector. This means that we have 2
paths we must consider when calculating the depth. The first path to
look at is the one that goes from the Root Combiner <strong>#1</strong>
back to the Windmill <strong>#14</strong>. This path is the main power
path. The second path goes from Root Combiner <strong>#1</strong> back
to the Solar Panel <strong>#16</strong>. If one of these paths exceed
the Max Depth limit of 16 components, you will start to see the error
message at Root Combiner <strong>#1</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/image50.png" /></p>
<p>The next image shows a Max Depth using an equal number of Windmills
and Batteries with a Nih Core.</p>

href="#circuit-delay-and-power-flow" class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuit
Delay and Power Flow</h1>
<h2 id="circuit-delay"><a href="#circuit-delay"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuit Delay</h2>
<p>Circuit Delay at its most basic, is the amount of time it takes power
to pass from one component to another. The amount of time we are talking
about is incredibly small but a lot of small increases will eventually
become a large amount of time. One way to test how fast rustricity is on
any server is by stringing a bunch of lights together, the more the
better, and watch how long it takes for all of them to turn on and off.
For this reason, it is impossible to say the specific amount of time it
takes for components to react but some do react slower or faster than
others.</p>
<p>All components that only have a power input and a passthrough power
output, will react at or around the same speed. These would be
components like lights. From the moment the light receives power to the
moment it sends power out, we will call this 1 unit of time. If power
passes through 2 lights, from the moment the first light receives power
to the moment the second light sends power out, we can call this 2 units
of time. The time it takes to pass through 3 lights, we call 3 units of
time.</p>
<p>Components with multiple outputs have their own delay, 1 for each
output. For example, the Splitter, it has 3 outputs. Power is sent out 1
output at a time. The amount of time from the moment the Splitter
receives power to the time the last output sends power out is equal to 1
unit of time. The Electrical Branch sends power through Power Out first
then Branch Out and this is equal to 2 units of time. On the Memory
Cell, it needs 3 units of time to flip outputs.</p>
<p>Batteries also have their own delay. When a battery has an Active
Usage of 0, it enters an ‘Off’ state. When the time comes for the
battery to power something, it must enter an ‘On’ state which has a
delay equal to 2 units of time. Keeping the battery in the ‘On’ state
with a Root Combiner or an Industrial Light eliminates the delay so you
have power right away.</p>
<h2 id="power-flow"><a href="#power-flow" class="anchor-link">*</a>Power
Flow</h2>
<p>Power Flow is the path electricity takes through a circuit and the
order of the path, aka the order of operation. We need to remember that
Rustricity is nothing more than lines of code that are processed 1 after
another. Not only does this create a Circuit Delay, as explained above,
it also only allows 1 component at a time to perform an action. This
creates the order of operation.</p>
<p>Using the picture below to help illustrate, when we flip on the
Switch, light 1 will power on followed by light 2 then light 3 and
finally light 4. When we flip the Switch off, light 1 will power
offfollowed by light 2 then light 3 and finally light 4. Power flow gets
alittle more complicated when we introduce components with
multipleoutputs.</p>
<p><img src="images/passtrough-chain.png" /></p>
<p>Starting with the Electrical Branch that has 2 outputs, power is
first sent through Power Out then power gets sent through Branch Out.
When it is removed, it will first be removed from Power Out then Branch
Out.</p>
<p><img src="images/branch-outputs.png" /></p>
<p>The Splitter is similar but it has 3 outputs. Power first goes
through Power Out 1 followed by Power Out 2 then Power Out 3. When power
is removed, it will be removed first from Power Out 1 followed by Power
Out 2 then Power Out 3.</p>
<p><img src="images/splitter-out.png" /></p>
<p>The Memory Cell is another component that has 2 outputs. Even though
it only sends power through 1 output at a time, Output will always react
before Inverted Output. This means that when we apply power to ‘Set’,
power will be sent out the Output first before we lose power from the
Inverted Output. When we apply power to ‘Reset’, we will first lose
power from Output before power is sent out the Inverted Output.</p>
<p><img src="images/powerflowmemcell.png" /></p>
<p>Looking at these components at the individual level should be fairly
easy to understand. When we combine components with multiple outputs, we
will start to create a semi-predictable path. Using the below image, we
know that the Electrical Branch will send power through Power Out first
before sending power through Branch Out. It will do this before either
Splitter attached to them will react. This gives us the following order
of operation, 1 through 8.</p>
<p><img src="images/powerflueebsplit.png" /></p>
<p>The Memory Cell acts similarly to the Electrical Branch. 1 output
will react before the other, the only difference is 1 output is losing
power while the other is gaining power. Let’s say we are going to flip
power from the Inverted Output to the Output. 1- Output will send out
power first. 2- Inverted Output will lose power next. 3, 4 and 5 will
send out power one at a time in order, followed by 6, 7 and 8 losing
power one at a time, in order. The order of operation is the exact same
when flipping power back over to Inverted Output from Output.</p>
<p><img src="images/powerflowmemsplit.png" /></p>
<p>So far we have been talking about components sending power or losing
power. There is another side to Power Flow and that is the order in
which a component receives power. Some components require power first
before getting toggled while with others, it doesn’t matter what input
gets power first, they will react once powered on.</p>
<p>Let’s start with components that will react no matter what input gets
power first.</p>
<p><code>Memory Cell</code> - It doesn’t matter if the side inputs or
the main input gets power first. Once the main input receives power, it
will put itself into the correct configuration based on what side inputs
are receiving power.</p>
<p><img src="images/memcellpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Counter</code> - Sending power to the side inputs, it will
count up or down and clear with no power provided to the main input.
Only once power is provided to the main input will the screen turn on to
display the number. If the number shown is the same as the target
number, power will be sent through.</p>
<p><img src="images/cntrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>RAND Switch</code> - Sending power to the side inputs will Set
and Reset the RAND Switch with no power provided to the main input. Only
once power is provided to the main input will power pass through or not
depending on the state of the switch. The side inputs only react when
they are provided with power. Having constant power on them when the
main power is removed or received will not affect the switch and it will
remain in the same state.</p>
<p><img src="images/randpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Blocker</code> - Sending power to the side input before sending
power to the main input will block power from passing through. However,
if you send power to the main input first and the very next operation,
send power to the side input, it should still block power from passing
through. If the delay between sending power to the main input then to
the side input is long enough, power will get sent through before it
gets blocked.</p>
<p><img src="images/blckrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p>The following components require power to their main input first
before sending power to their secondary inputs.</p>
<p><code>Electric Furnace</code> - If you want to use the secondary
inputs to turn the furnace on or off, you must send power to the main
input first. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the
main input receives power, the furnace will remain in whatever state it
was in before the main input lost power.</p>
<p><img src="images/frncpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Conveyor</code> - If you want to use the secondary inputs to
turn the conveyor on or off, you must send power to the main input
first. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the main
input receives power, the conveyor will remain in whatever state it was
in before the main input lost power.</p>
<p><img src="images/cnvyrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Timer</code> - If you want to use the secondary input to toggle
the timer on, you must first send power to the main input. If you send
power to the secondary input first, when the main input receives power,
the timer will not toggle on.</p>
<p><img src="images/tmrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Boom Box</code> -If you want to use the secondary input to
toggle the boom box on to play music, you must first send power to the
main input. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the
main input receives power, the boom box will not toggle on and not play
music.</p>
<p><img src="images/mbmxpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Elevator</code> - If you want to use the secondary inputs to
call the elevator to a floor, you must first send power to the main
input. If you send power to the secondary inputs first, when the main
input receives power, the elevator will not be called to a floor.</p>
<p><img src="images/lvtrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p>We have covered how power flow is affected by components with
multiple outputs. We have covered components that are affected by the
order they receive power flow. The last piece of the puzzle is something
I don’t have enough information to properly explain atm. It appears that
the game can prioritize some components over another. I hope to one day
be able to explain this in detail but to help illustrate how a complex
circuit behaves, I have broken down the Nih Core to show the order of
operation.</p>
<p><img src="images/nihcorepowbat2.png" /></p>
<p>The left side shows the order of operation when switching from
battery backup to windmill power.</p>
<h4 id="main-power">Main Power:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>The amount of power coming into the Nih Core rises above 106.<br />
