href="#the-rust-electrical-handbook" class="anchor-link">*</a>The RUST
Electrical Handbook</h1>
<p><em>You are the <span id="visitorcount"></span>th visitor !</em></p>
<p>A continually updated all inclusive guide to everything electrical in
the game Rust. This handbook will include everything you need to find,
craft, wire, and utilize different useful circuits in game. These
designs have been curated from many community submissions into the
simplest, cheapest, and most optimized versions possible.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, everything is subject to change, be
reorganised or moved to some other sub pages, but any info still valid
in game wont be removed.</p>
<p>All of the information you find here is comming from a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Doc</a> by <span class="citation"
data-cites="SwiftCoyote">@SwiftCoyote</span>, so thanks to him and all
the people in the <a href="https://discord.gg/emB98hrupy">Rustricity
Workshop</a> community that contribute to it! The Google Doc will always
be a little more update then this website as the website needs to be
rebuilt after each change.</p>
<p>A massive Thank You to <span class="citation"
data-cites="3YE">@3YE</span> on <a
href="https://discord.rustrician.io/">Discord</a> for creating the
website and teaching me (SwiftCoyote) how to update and maintain it.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to contribute to this project, there is multiple ways you
can do it by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding a bug, spelling or grammaitical error, or making a
suggestion, please make them on the Google Document - <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Document</a><br />
</li>
<li>You could contribute code that fix or add to the website,</li>
<li>But the principal thing is the accuracy of the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its made in a way so someone could edit the website content without
needing to know html/css/javascript. All the content is writen in
markdown format (similar to discord messages: *<em>italic</em>*,
**<strong>bold</strong>**, etc…) For now, I havent written something
that explains how to do it but you can ask <span class="citation"

<h2 id="common-traits"><a href="#common-traits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Common Traits</h2>
<p>These tools take no damage, have a stack size of 1, are default BPs
and can only be crafted.</p>
<p>To change the colour of a wire/hose/pipe in place, with
Wire/Hose/Pipe Tool in hand, hold Reload <code>R</code> to select the
colour then look at an IO connection and press Reload
<code>R</code>.</p>
<p>Wire/Hose/Pipe length is limited to 30 meters with 16 anchor points
using the left mouse button.</p>
<p>If a hose/wire/pipe is accidentally attached to the wall in the wrong
spot, look away and right click once. It will remove the last anchor
point. Holding the right mouse button down will clear the
wire/hose/pipe.</p>
<p>To remove a hose/wire from a component, look at the connection point
and hold down the right mouse button.</p>
<p>Holding ‘Left Shift’ allows the placement of anchor points on
deployed entities like boxes or chairs (Only Pipes ATM).</p>
<p>When hoses or wires are placed on walls and the wall is destroyed,
the hoses and wires will remain in place, but pipes will break! They can
also break when doing anything that changes the hitbox of the thing they
are placed on, ie: upgrading walls can break pipes!</p>
<p>Wear Diving Fins to get cleaner and straighter hose/wire/pipe
placement. They force the player to move slower allowing for better
accuracy when strafing left and right.</p>
<p>Wire Tracing: Left click a pre wired connection, only that connection
will have the wire animation making it easier to follow its path.</p>
<p>To increase or decrease the range of the auto snap when getting close
to an IO connection, in the F1 console, change
<code>client.lookatradius</code> from <code>0.2</code> to
<code>0.05</code>. This lets anchor points be placed closer to IO
connections.</p>
<p>If the server has it enabled, turn on Wire Slack by holding the Wire
Tool and press <code>USE</code>, default is <code>E</code>. Hold Sprint,
shift, to increase and Duck, ctrl, to decrease. This will give wires
some slack rather than being straight between 2 points.</p>

<p>There is no way around this. If electrical circuits are going to
function, power must be generated somehow. These are the components that
produce power. For a more in depth explanation, have a look at <a

<li>Wind Turbines operate in both day and night.</li>
<li>The amount of power they output is heavily influenced by the number
of floors above the ground they are, not sea level.</li>
<li>They will produce more power, more often the more floors above
ground they are placed.</li>
<li>There is a small area at the base of the turbine, on some sheet
metal where you can place components.</li>
<li>A turbine made on an iceberg, will calculate its output based on sea
level down to the ocean bottom. This means no additional height above
sea level will increase its height calculation.</li>
<li>There needs to be a minimum of 15 meters or 5 foundations distance
between turbines. This will prevent 1 turbine blocking the wind for
another.</li>
<li>Requires a single square or 2 triangles to be placed on.</li>
<li>Cannot be picked up with a hammer.</li>

<li>Aka, a Flip Flop but has a Set, Reset and Toggle.</li>
<li>The Reset input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through
Inverted Output.</li>
<li>The Set input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through
Output.</li>
<li>The Toggle input will cause the Memory Cell to flip which output
power is going through.</li>
<li>The side inputs are prioritized from top to bottom. This means if
power is applied to Set then power is applied to Reset or Toggle,
nothing will happen. If power is applied to Reset then power is applied
to Toggle, nothing will happen. If power is applied to Reset then power
is applied to Set, it will force the Memory Cell to send power through
Output.</li>
<li>When switching from one output to the other, Output will always
react before Inverted Output.</li>
<li>The 2 outputs are currently bugged. When you try to see the power
info by pointing at the outputs with a Wire Tool, it will show the
incoming power being evenly split between both outputs. This is a visual
bug. 100% of the power is only coming out of 1 of the outputs.</li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To configure the Counter, with a Wire Tool in hand, look at it and
hold Use(E). The options are Set Target and Show Passthrough.</li>
<li>Set Target allows for programming a number between 1 and 100. When
the Counter is equal to the target number, or greater, the Counter will
pass power through.</li>
<li>Show Passthrough will show the amount of incoming power.</li>
<li>When power is applied to Increment Counter, the Counter will count
up by 1.</li>
<li>When power is applied to Decrement Counter, the Counter will count
down by 1.</li>
<li>When power is applied to Clear Counter, the Counter will reset back
to 0.</li>
<li>The Counter does not need power to count up, down or be
cleared.</li>
<li>When set to Show Passthrough, if it only shows 1, connect the output
(Passthrough) to any input on any component. This will cause the counter
to actually pass power through so it can show the amount.</li>
<li>Using a Counter on the floor on its thin side, within a 1 meter
radius, if an item like a furnace or sleeping bag is removed, the
Counter will also disappear. When placing or removing building
structures, the Counter will also disappear.</li>
<li>The following items can be placed on top of a counter that is placed
down on its thin side: Lantern, Jackolanterns, carvable pumpkins,
sandbag and concrete barricades, pookie bear, twitch trophy, eggs and
the small candle. Placing multiple counters together to create a larger
pad, you can put larger things like a small battery on top.</li>

<li>To use in RF mode, enter your inventory and select the charge. Click
on ‘Enable RF’ then ‘Set Frequency’. Use left click to throw the
explosive charge onto something and wait 10 seconds for the beeping to
stop. The green light will be on. Set a RF Broadcaster or RF Transmitter
to the same frequency and transmit when you want the charge to
detonate.</li>
<li>Due to the introduction of RF mode, RF Broadcasters and Transmitters

<li>This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.</li>
<li>Requires TC authorization to change strobe settings. Look at the
light and hold USE(<code>E</code>) to change the frequency of the strobe
between 10hz, 20hz and 40hz or to manually turn it on.</li>
<li>Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that
dictates the state of the light. For example, if power is constantly
sent to TURN ON, the light turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the
light will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF, the light will
not turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. Power will need
to be removed then reapplied power to TURN ON for the light to turn back
on.</li>
<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the light on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet
point. If power is applied to TOGGLE, the light will turn on. While the
light is on, if power is sent to TURN OFF, the light will turn off. When
power is removed from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE, the
light will not turn back on. On the other hand if power is sent to TURN
ON, the light will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the light will
stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, if power is removed from
TOGGLE and the light will turn off. This is because when power is
removed from TOGGLE, it tells the light to turn off.</li>
<li>They take damage when active at a rate of
<strong>1hp/3min42sec</strong>.</li>
<li>They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the

<li>This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market.</li>
<li>When Active, it creates a fog cloud in front of it that covers an
area equal to a 2x2 and is thickest below half height walls. Consumes
low grade fuel at 1 per minute.</li>
<li>When set to Motion, it only gets set off by non authorized players
and will emit fog every couple seconds creating a thicker cloud directly
in front of it. Setting the fogger at a half wall height, the constant
emission of the fogger creates a thick cloud at eye level. Consumes low
grade fuel at 10 per minute.</li>
<li>The fogger only emits a cloud as long as the non authorized player
is moving. If the player stops moving, the fogger turns off.</li>
<li>A cloud takes 5 seconds to form and 40 seconds to disappear.</li>
<li>Increasing the number of foggers increases the density of the cloud.
4 foggers is enough to block the light from fire and 5 will block light
from electrical lighting.</li>
<li>Fog will fall toward the ground and accumulate on any horizontal
surface. The higher the fogger the thinner the cloud.</li>
<li>Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
hold Use(<code>E</code>) to Activate, Open or turn on Motion.</li>
<li>Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that
dictates the state of the fogger. For example, if constant power is sent
to TURN ON, the fogger turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the fogger
will turn off. When power is removed from TURN OFF, the fogger will not
turn back on, even with power still going to TURN ON. Power will need to
be removed and reapplied to TURN ON for the fogger to turn back on.</li>
<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the fogger on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet
point. If power is applied to TOGGLE, the fogger will turn on. While the
fogger is on, if power is sent to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off.
When power is removed from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE,
the fogger will not turn back on. On the other hand if power is sent to
TURN ON, the fogger will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the
fogger will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, when power is
removed from TOGGLE, the fogger will turn off. This is because when
power is removed from TOGGLE, it tells the fogger to turn off.</li>
<li>They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the
ground.</li>
<li>Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp.</li>

<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the machine on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. When TURN ON receives power, the machine
will turn on and stay on when TURN ON loses power. When TURN OFF
receives power, it will always turn the machine off. If power is
currently going to TURN OFF, sending power to the other inputs will turn
the machine on.</li>

<li>They are used for destroying player flown aircraft, i.e. minicopter,
scrap heli and hot air balloon. It doesnt matter if there is a pilot or
if the pilot has TC auth. They shoot the craft, not the player, unless
in Defender Mode.</li>
<li>Looking at the SAM and holding Use(<code>E</code>) allows a player
to enable and disable Defender Mode. In Defender Mode it will only
target incoming MLRS rockets.</li>
<li>To successfully defend from an MLRS attack, it is recommended
placing 3 SAM Sites on the side of the base that is nearest the
Abandoned Military Base and build them as high as the base is tall.</li>
<li>Has a range of 150 meters, or 1 grid square.</li>
<li>It will not target anything below its own height.</li>
<li><strong>Has Target</strong> will pulse out 1rW if it takes damage
and will release a constant 1rW if it locks a target.</li>
<li><strong>Low Ammo</strong> will start to output 1rW when there is 10
SAM Ammo or less. When it has no more ammo it will stop outputting
power.</li>
<li><strong>No Ammo</strong> will output 1rW constantly when there is no
more ammo.</li>
<li>If 100 power is given to the SAM, 75 will come out Passthrough.</li>
<li>Must be placed on flat surfaces.</li>

<ul>
<li>A player must be authorized to open the menu by looking at it and
holding Use(<code>E</code>). There are 7 options to choose from.
<ul>
<li><code>Open -</code> This opens the inventory where guns and ammo can
be placed. This includes all weapons that fire Pistol Bullets, 5.56
Rifle Ammo or 12 Gauge Buckshot as well as the Nailgun and Trumpet.</li>
<li><code>Peacekeeper mode -</code> It will never attack an authorized
player. It won’t attack an unauthorized player unless they become
aggressive. This mode also disables players from being able to control
them from a Computer Station or the Rust+ app.</li>
<li><code>Attack All -</code> Is the default mode and can only be
selected if the turret was placed into Peacekeeper mode. This mode is
required for remote control.</li>
<li><code>Rotate -</code> Rotates the turret by 180 degrees.</li>
<li><code>Authorize friend -</code> Search or select a player to
authorize them. Once authorized, the turret will never shoot them.</li>
<li><code>Clear Authorization List -</code> Removes all players from
being authorized.</li>
<li><code>Deauthorize -</code> Removes the player selecting it from
being authorized.</li>
<li><code>Set ID -</code> Naming the turret allows for player control.
Give the turret a name, then enter that name into a Computer Station or
the Rust+ app and take control. Move with the mouse and left click to
shoot. Anyone can add the ID to any Computer Station and take control.
Make the ID something other won’t guess and restrict access to any
Computer Station with these IDs to trusted individuals only.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are 3 outputs:
<ul>
<li><code>Has Target</code> will pulse out 1rW if the turret takes
damage and will release a constant 1rW if it locks a target.</li>
<li><code>Low Ammo</code> will start to output 1rW when there is 50 ammo
or less. When it has no more ammo it will stop outputting power.</li>
<li><code>No Ammo</code> will output 1rW constantly when there is no
ammo.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Range is 30 meters or 10 square foundations.</li>
<li>When controlled by a player from a Computer Station, the visual
range is approximately 21 square foundations or 63 meters.</li>
<li>Add the ID to the <code>Rust+</code> app to control the turret from
outside the game. The player must disconnect from the server before
remote access is allowed.</li>
<li>The turret has a 180 degree detection arch.</li>
<li>Must be placed on flat surfaces.</li>
<li>Try to place them in a way they cannot be baited and drained.</li>
<li>They can shoot through 2 layers of Chainlink Fence.</li>

<p>It is a system that lets you collect, store, transport and distribute
water in game. It functions similarly to the electrical system in that
it has its own hand tool and you connect components in the same way.</p>
<p>Its primary use is for farming plants like hemp, berries and other
foods.</p>
<p>Gravity is something you will need to be aware of. When sending water
down towards the ground, gravity will assist you. If at any point you
need to route water up away from the ground, you will require a
component that can pump and that component will need electricity to
function.</p>

The industrial system is a series of pipes that can connect many
different containers together for the purpose of automating the
movement, crafting and smelting of items. Have a look at the <a

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 5 second rule. From turning on to the first transfer is 5
seconds. Between each transfer is 5 seconds. This is often referred to
as a tick.</li>
<li>Anyone can turn them on or off but only players with TC
authorization can access the filters.</li>
<li>Has 3 outputs. A passthrough, Filter Pass and Filter Fail.</li>
<li>It will display an image of the item being transferred as it
transfers.</li>
<li>2 Conveyors cannot be connected together in a row. They must be
separated by a Storage Adapter.</li>
<li>Outputs filter pass and fail, do not consume power. This is 1 free
1rW.</li>
<li><code>Filter Pass</code> will send out 1rW constantly when the
conditions of the filter are met. It will continue to send power for 5
seconds when the Conveyor will check to see if the conditions are still
met. If they are, Filter Pass will continue to send out power. If the
conditions are not met, it will stop sending out power.</li>
<li><code>Filter Fail</code> will send out 1rW constantly when the
conditions of the filter are not met. It will continue to send power for
5 seconds when the Conveyor will check to see if the conditions are
still not being met. If they are still not met, Filter Fail will
continue to send out power. If the conditions are met, it will stop
sending out power.</li>
<li>Both the Filter Pass and Fail outputs will allow the Active Usage of
inactive components through. This means if the circuit is using an
Inline backup, the offline components will register Active Usage on the
battery causing drain.</li>
<li>There is a max of 12 items that can be filtered.</li>
<li>You can filter by specific items or by a general filter groups (
Ammo, Clothing, Components, Construction, Electrical, Food, Fun,
Medical, Other, Resources, Tools, Traps, Weapons )</li>
<li><code>Filter Item settings:</code>
<ul>
<li><code>MAX:</code> conveyor will stop moving this item when all
target containers reach this amount.</li>
<li><code>MIN:</code> conveyor will only move items in excess of this
amount from all input containers.</li>
<li><code>BUFFER:</code> conveyor will only move in chunks of this size.
(When used in tandem with the MAX setting, it is useful for crafting
recipes with blue prints to help eliminate overfilling and trickle
filling of Industrial Crafters.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Filter Mode settings:</code>
<ul>
<li><code>ANY ITEM:</code> This is the default setting. It will move all
items unless there are Item Filters being used.</li>
<li><code>REQUIRE ALL:</code> All item filters must be satisfied before
transferring materials will begin.
<ul>
<li>Used for requiring more than 1 item to begin transfer.</li>
<li>This filter works as expected if only using 1 storage adapter on a
single container.</li>
<li>When all items are present, Conveyor will set Filter Pass and
transfer.</li>
<li>When using multiple containers with a single adapter on each, all of
each item type must be contained to a single box. The single box can
contain all of more than 1 item.</li>
<li><code>Bug:</code> When using 2 storage adapters, either on a single
container to 2 containers, it won’t transfer anything unless it is only
1 item in 1 box. If all the items in the filter list are present,
Conveyor will set Filter Fail and not transfer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>EXCLUDE LISTED ITEMS:</code> Only items not listed will be
moved.</li>
<li>Items in the filter list will be prevented from transferring.</li>
<li>When using more than 1 filter type, the conveyor will set Filter
Pass even when the item in the container is on the exclusion list.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <code>Current Items</code> list can be copied from one conveyor
to another using the <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>
buttons. Holding Sprint(<code>Shift</code>) lets a user
<strong><em>Copy(JSON)</em></strong>. This can then be pasted into a
text file allowing a player to share their conveyor filters outside of
the game and between servers. Hold Sprint(<code>Shift</code>) to
<strong><em>Paste(JSON)</em></strong>. This will not copy the ‘Filter
Mode’.<br />
</li>
<li>If it has power when the server restoots, it will remain powered on
after the restart.</li>
<li>There is an Industrial Max Depth of 32 components on either side
(input/output) of the Conveyor.</li>
<li>There is a max of 32 Storage Adapters on either side (input/output)
of the Conveyor.</li>
<li>It will move stackable items in groups of 60 items from up to 12
stacks at a time.</li>
<li>Unstackable items count as 1 stack each so it will move up to 12
items at a time.</li>
<li>Every additional Storage Adapter added to a container will increase
the number of stacks the conveyor can take by 12.</li>
<li>They can be placed on all surfaces and the ground.</li>
<li>Has the ability to be rotated using Reload(R).</li>
<li><code>As of 7/16/2023,</code> stackable items that also have health,
like Ladders, Solar Panels, Fuses for example, will brick the Conveyor
if their health has been decreased and are unable to stack. The Conveyor
will remain in a Filter Pass state because the item could be moved, but
because it is unable to be placed in an existing stack, it wont move the
item. Do not place these broken or damaged items in the sorting
system.</li>
<li>The term <code>Item</code> is specifically referring to the
<code>Item ID</code> number. For example, the hazmat suit has different
skins but they actually have different ID’s. This should not be an issue
but some items will still be transferred even though the MAX item filter
has been met. One example is the Arctic and Lumberjack suits. They are
hazmats but even with a MAX filter of 1, 1 of each will be sent. The
default skin will always fulfill the MAX requirement and block the
remodeled versions, but the remodeled versions will not block each
other. This issue also exists with the following items:
<ul>
<li>Hazmat Suit</li>
<li>Sky Lanterns</li>
<li>AK</li>
<li>Metal Tools</li>
<li>Torches</li>
</ul></li>

Voice Props DLC to craft cassettes.</li>
<li>TC Auth is not required to change the name or access the cassette in
the answering machine.</li>
<li>There are 3 types of cassettes, Short(10sec), Medium(20sec) and
Long(30sec). Use a Cassette Recorder to record a message then place the
cassette in the answering machine. When someone calls and you
don’t answer, the caller will hear your message and leave a message of
their own for you to play back later.</li>
<li>After 3 rings the answering machine message will begin to play. To
leave a voicemail, press the spacebar when you hear the answering
machine’s message. To listen to your voicemail, use the phone and at the
bottom of the screen select voicemail.</li>
<li>To use the phone, look at it and when you see MAKE CALL, press
Use(<code>E</code>) to use.</li>
<li>You can give your phone a name and it will appear in the Directory.
All phones are automatically assigned a number.</li>
<li>You can add phones to your contacts list by adding the phone number
or name.</li>
<li>Use the Directory to find the phones at monuments or random peoples

<h1 id="the-structure-of-a-base-circuit"><a
href="#the-structure-of-a-base-circuit" class="anchor-link">*</a>The
Structure of a Base Circuit</h1>
<p>All circuits for a base follow the same basic structure. It doesn’t
matter if the base has 1 circuit or more, they all contain 4 main parts
with an optional 5th part that does not have a static location. We have
the Power Source, Battery Backup, Distribution, End Devices/Circuits and
the 5th, Destruction Detection. Using the following flow chart we can
help illustrate this.</p>
<p><img src="images/image38.png" /></p>
<p>Moving top to bottom, every circuit needs a power source. You have 3
choices, Windmills, Solar Panels or Small Generators.</p>
<p>We then take our source power and feed it to a Battery Backup. You
have 2 choices, Inlines or Bypasses. Either way, you must ensure you are
supplying enough power to keep your batteries charged.</p>
<p>From the Battery Backup, we will then need to distribute the power to
the different systems in the base. There are 3 options, a Fixed or
Dynamic Bus or a Configure Siphon.</p>
<p>The End Devices and Circuits are your turrets, lights, cameras,
farms, door controllers, sensor grids, ect. It is these components that
will consume the majority of power. Knowing what circuits you want to
include will be important to know when deciding how much power you need
to produce and how big your Battery Backup will be.</p>
<p>The Destruction Detection system should be included in most circuits
and if limited to one, placing one after the Battery Backup is probably
the best option.</p>

<h1 id="centralized-vs-decentralized-theory"><a
href="#centralized-vs-decentralized-theory"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized vs Decentralized Theory</h1>
<p>When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing electricity, we are
talking about 1 of 2 things. We are either talking about the physical
placement of components or we are talking about power flow from a source
to the end component. In a 100% completely centralized system, the
electrical circuit would collect, store and distribute power all through
a single circuit and all of this would be located in a single electrical
room/area. A 100% completely decentralized system would have independent
circuits with their own power source, battery backup, and distribution
located in different rooms/areas for each system and section of a base.
These 2 concepts exist on the extreme ends of a spectrum. The best
circuit does not need to be one or the other, it can be located anywhere
in between.</p>
<p>There are several variables including the server, wipe length, group
size, the base, server limits and electrical experience that will
influence the solution that works for your situation. This is not a 1
size fits all. The best circuit is the one that does the job you need it
to do when you need it to do it.</p>
<p>First we will talk about the physical placement then we will get into
the electrical circuit(s).</p>
<h1 id="locations"><a href="#locations"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Locations</h1>
<p>When talking about centralizing or decentralizing the physical
location of components, it should be understood that we are NOT talking
about the auto turrets on the roof for defense. We are NOT talking about
the quality of life improvements of having electric heaters everywhere
because the build location was in the arctic biome. We are NOT talking
about the components placed on walls for the purpose of destruction
detection. What we are talking about is the location of the core
components. We are talking about the circuits that power, control and
support the defensive systems, monitoring systems or quality of life
systems. We are talking about the location of collection points for
power sources, battery backups, the batteries, power buses and all the
logic circuits for everything electric in a base. We are talking about
the location a Windmill sends its power to or the place where the wire
that powers the auto turret comes from.  </p>
<h2 id="centralized-location"><a href="#centralized-location"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized Location</h2>
<p><img src="images/image37.png" /></p>
<p>Where you place these components is very important because you don’t
want to make it easy for raiders to destroy them. You want to protect
your circuits like you protect your TC. Centralizing the placement of
these components in a single room or area is very convenient. It’s easy
to add layers of honeycomb, add lots of traps and doors to protect but
can come at the potential risk that if raiders get into this room/area,
with 1 rocket they can destroy and disable everything. You could place
it in a spot where raiders would not think to or want to raid. When
centralizing, the location should not be an afterthought. It should be
preplanned into the base.</p>
<p>No matter where the room is, hiding the wires that will need to lead
to and from this room is a must. They should be either hidden out of
sight or mislead the raiders as to the rooms location. Wires are limited
in length so in smaller bases, it is much easier to reach all the
components outside the room, like auto turrets, without requiring extra
components to extend the wire. In larger bases, this can become a
problem if you don’t have a safe place to put components to extend the
wires. A safe place should not be easier to destroy than the end
component itself. As an example, if you are using a memory cell to
extend a wire to an auto turret. The memory cell should not be easier to
destroy than the auto turret it connects to. When it comes to wire
extensions, any component with a passthrough works but IMO, Industrial
Lights are the best because they are cheap to craft and easy to make
look like it is just base lighting giving it the perfect camouflage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="decentralized-locations"><a href="#decentralized-locations"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Decentralized Locations</h2>
<p><img src="images/image107.jpg" /></p>
<p>Decentralizing the physical locations of circuits is where there are
2 or more electrical rooms/areas. These locations should be hard to find
and harder to raid. These locations should be rooms that raiders would
not think is worth raiding. The more rooms there are, the less likely
raiders will disable every system when cutting the base in half with
rockets. The larger the base is, the easier it should be spreading out
the electrical rooms/areas. The more spread out these locations are the
more protected they are and has the added benefit of not needing wire
extensions to reach end devices in a given area.</p>
<p>Hiding your wires is very important. Any information a raider can
collect about the locations of your electrical rooms should be
minimized. With the limitation of wire length, decentralizing can be an
excellent way of distributing power closer to where it is actually
needed. Eliminating the need to use wire extensions makes things more
secure and builders won’t need to build in extra rooms just for this.
These locations could be anywhere but it is recommended you plan them
into the build for more security. Electrical rooms should not be an
afterthought just like the disconnected TC was not an afterthought.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="circuits"><a href="#circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuits</h1>
<p>When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing circuits, we are
talking about how we are delivering power from the source to the
different systems and end components. It is crucial to understand the
structure of a base circuit because it makes it easier to visualize the
difference between Centralized and Decentralized circuits. To help
explain this, we will use 3 different end devices/circuits. First - Auto
Turrets, Second - A HBHF grid to know where enemies are and Third -
Lights.</p>
<p>Centralized is a single system with all power sources, destruction
detection, batteries, power distribution and end systems connected in a
single circuit. To be more specific, all power sources get combined and
run through a destruction detector into a battery backup system. From
the battery back up we provide all of the end devices and circuits with
a single distribution system.</p>
<p><img src="images/image70.png" /></p>
<p>Decentralized is when we provide all of our end systems with their
own power source, destruction detection(optional), battery and power
distribution. Decentralization is a concept that exists on a spectrum.
On one extreme it could be as simple as cutting the base in half and
using 1 circuit for the North and 1 for the South or putting the turrets
on 1 circuit and keeping the HBHF and lights on another. On the other
extreme end we break every end system down as far as we want. Let’s
start with auto turrets and let’s say we have 15 of them. 3 per side,
North, South, East and West as well as 3 on the roof. That could be 5
separate circuits. 5 separate power sources with 5 different detectors,
5 battery backups and 5 separate distributors. Then we could also do the
same with the HBHF grind. Separate that into 5 circuits. Destruction
detection could be included in all of those circuits and separate stand
alone systems could be added for all the walls on each of the 4 sides.
Even the lights if you wanted to could be decentralized.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image3.png" /></p>
<p>Knowing ahead of time what systems your base will use, how much power
they consume, the size of the base and the environment being played in
(competitive vs casual), will influence your design. For best results,
design the base build around your circuits so you never need to
sacrifice functionality or security.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="centralized-circuits"><a href="#centralized-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized Circuits</h2>
<p>Here we can look at some examples of a centralized circuit. Like we
stated before, the idea is to combine everything into a single circuit.
These have the advantage of being less complex but at the disadvantage
of having single points of failure. The first circuit we can look at in
the image below is pretty simple. We have a single source of power
feeding an inline battery backup supplying power to our end components
and circuits through a single distributor. We are starting with an
inline backup because it does not scale efficiently in a centralized
environment and it is easier to see points of failure. If the battery
gets destroyed or if the first Electrical Branch gets taken out, the
entire system goes offline.</p>
<p><img src="images/image65.png" /></p>
<p>The trick with an Inline system is to produce enough power to keep
your battery charged but not produce so much that power is wasted. A
large battery needs a constant input of 125 to not drain if its Active
Usage is maxed out at 100. With an input of 127, it will take that
battery 34 days to fully charge from empty. Always try to precharge the
batteries above 3,000rWm before letting them power the circuit. Anything
above what’s needed to maintain the battery will be a waste of power
when the battery is full.</p>
<p>When a circuit requires more than 100 power, and the goal is still to
centralize, switch to a bypass system like the Nih Core and max out your
batteries potential. If the amount of reliable power that can be
produced is limited, the goal should be to minimize the battery’s Active
Usage to a state that is manageable. The lower it is, the less power
needed to maintain the battery and the longer it will last when main
power is gone. Refer to the section titled Battery Active Usage Vs
Actual Power Consumed for a better understanding of the 2 game
mechanics.</p>
<p>This next example uses the same end systems but has multiple power
sources and multiple batteries to support the same or more components.
It uses the Nih Core bypass battery backup and provides power to all the
different end systems through a single distributor. The number of end
systems you want to run and the amount of power they will consume will
dictate how much power you need to generate and the number of batteries
you need to support everything in the event of a power outage. If your
circuit needs 160rW, we will use 2 large batteries. If we need 470rw, we
will use 5 large batteries. DO NOT mix and match battery sizes.</p>
<p> <img src="images/image12.png" /></p>
<p>Before it was said that the above example could support the same or
more components. The Nih Core really is meant to scale up to larger
power demands but let’s say the demand is only 100, that means we have
built in some redundancy. 1 turbine or battery could be destroyed and
the circuit would still function as normal. This is an expensive way of
having redundancy but it does work. This is meant to be easily scalable
to any size power load but once we start to root combine batteries, we
should try to maximize the combined batteries potential by consuming as
much as possible. This means that if we have 2 large batteries, we
should try to use as much of the 200rW as possible. When batteries get
root combined, they do not share the load as one would expect.</p>
<p>For example, we have a circuit with 2 large batteries supporting a
load of 50. It would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2
batteries equals 25 per battery, but rustricity doesn’t work like that.
That 50 power is taken from both batteries and is seen as Active Usage.
<img src="images/image128.png" /></p>
<p>This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all
the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage. Active Usage is
used to calculate how fast a battery drains. If we are forcing batteries
to max drain then we might as well try to use as much as the combined
power the batteries will provide.</p>
<p>It is never good practice to mix and match different size batteries.
A large battery will last 4 hours, a medium battery will last 3 hours
and small batteries will last 15 minutes. If you mix and match, you can
only rely on maximum power for the amount of time the smallest battery
will last. For example, 2 large batteries and 1 medium for a total of
250rW. For only 3 hours will you get 250, the last hour will only
provide 200. There are situations where mixing is useful, but not for
the main battery backup on a centralized circuit.</p>
<p>Centralized circuits are simple, easy to work with and scalable. On
paper, you can make a centralized circuit very large and consume a lot
of power. The reality is to produce a lot and store a lot of power, you
will need a lot of land to build it on. In this next example, on paper,
we have 9 turbines on the 10th floor with 9 backup batteries feeding 36
auto turrets divided by 9 per North, South, East and West sides. It also
has 3 HBHF Sensors per side, Search Lights on each side and a bunch of
lights. The circuit is only an example and is not using its full power
potential. It could include a grid of tesla coils, destruction
detection, a camera network, automatic doors, TC/Vending Machine and
storage monitoring, an indoor garden, a system that makes your base look
online when you are offline and much more. The point here is size, very
large.</p>
<p><img src="images/image58.png" /></p>
<p>It is not so easy to see, with a circuit this large, and the ability
to be much larger, how one would go abouts physically building this. It
would be possible to centralize the location of the battery backup and
distribution but the size of the base will probably call for multiple
wire extensions. Any component can be used to extend a wire. The idea is
to make that component as cheap as possible. Only consuming 1 power and
being the resource cheapest component is the Industrial Lights. They are
easy to integrate as base lighting giving them the perfect camouflage.
Decentralizing the locations of a centralized circuit is possible but
difficult especially on large bases. At a certain point, you may find it
easier to just decentralize the circuit itself along with the locations.
 </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="decentralized-circuits"><a href="#decentralized-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Decentralized Circuits</h2>
<p>Decentralizing circuits really comes down to how extreme you want to
take it. The idea behind decentralizing is adding security and
reliability by segmenting different systems and areas with their own
independent power supplies and backups. Keep in mind, the type of
battery backup you choose is up to you but for our examples, we will
stick with inlines because it takes up less room in the pictures.</p>
<p>The first example shows decentralizing by separating the different
end circuits with independent power supplies and battery backups. The
Auto Turrets get their own power supply and inline battery. Same for the
SAM sites, interior lights, exterior lights and HBHF grid, they all have
their own power supply and inline battery backup.</p>
<p><img src="images/image55.png" /></p>
<p>While decentralizing based on end circuits is an option, if the
battery powering that circuit gets destroyed, that entire circuit will
become disabled. Having all your auto turrets go offline during a raid
is never a good thing. A more secure option would be to decentralize by
location. To keep the idea simple for the next example, let’s breakup a
base into 5 sections, North, South, East, West and the roof. By giving
each group their own power supply and backup, it prevents the entire
base from going offline when raiders destroy both the power supply and
battery backup. Decentralizing the circuit makes it a lot easier to
decentralize the locations. Wire length is limited, so depending on the
size of the base, being able to put the power source, battery backup and
distribution in a location that minimizes the need to wire extensions is
very appealing. If the base is of a smaller size, putting the power
supply, battery backup and distribution on the North side that powers
the South side has the clear advantage that in the event raiders come
through the South side, when they hit the electrical room on the South
side, it only disables the North side of the base. It is recommended
that when needing to extend wires, if you can’t put the extension
component in a protected area, use an industrial light and integrate it
into your base lighting.</p>
<p><img src="images/image54.png" /></p>
<h2 id="hybrid-circuits"><a href="#hybrid-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Hybrid Circuits</h2>
<p>A hybrid circuit is one that both centralizes, for convenience, and
decentralizes, for security, different parts of the same circuit. While
it is more common to see hybridization between power sources and battery
backup, it can also be done with distribution. To help demonstrate this
concept, we have the following 3 examples. The first 2 are using Inline
Battery Backups because it’s the easiest way to demonstrate the concept.
In each example, a Counter is used to both show the available amount of
power but also represents an end circuit like lights or turrets.</p>
<p>This first example demonstrates decentralizing the main power by
having each power source charge its own battery, with a centralized
Inline backup by combining the batteries before powering a circuit. This
is a less than ideal way to set up your power production and battery
backup. Keep in mind that Root Combiners do not share the load between
batteries. This means that a circuit needing 100 power or more will
force all the batteries to have a max Active Usage of 100. Read the
section <a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Battery
Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumed</a> for an in depth explanation
into Active Usage.</p>
<p><img src="images/dectr-pwr-ctr-bkp.png" /></p>
<p>This kind of battery configuration is convenient to achieve a lot of
power on 1 line but because in this example we are using Inline
batteries, this becomes progressively more expensive to maintain as you
need to be producing a significant amount more power than you need to.
This also removes the ability to take advantage of game mechanics to
minimize Active Usage on the batteries which should be a primary focus
when using an Inline backup.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to power 18 Auto Turrets. That is 180rW plus the
cost of distribution so we are going to need 2 large batteries which
give us 200 power, just like in the picture below. With no load sharing
between the batteries, they both will have an Active Usage of 100. With
the battery’s 80% efficiency, we need to give each battery 125rW. That’s
a minimum of 250rW we need to produce all the time so the batteries do
not drain.</p>
<p><img src="images/centbat250.png" /></p>
<p>If you have already read Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power
Consumed, you will know it is possible to power 9 turrets from 1
battery. Pictured below, if we power 9 turrets from 1 battery and the
other 9 from the other battery and each battery has its own power
source, this allows each battery to only have an Active Usage of 90.
With the batteries 80%, we only need a power supply of 114rW per battery
for a total of 228rW to not lose power.</p>
<p><img src="images/decentbat228.png" /></p>
<p>The larger this is scaled up, it is easy to see how much wasted
power, time and materials there are when trying to centralize the
batteries when each battery has its own power source. That is why it is
seen as unsustainable for use in situations that are continuously
online, however, if you have a circuit that spends most of its time
offline and there are long enough periods of time between activity to
let the batteries charge, then it becomes much more practical to just
get a lot of power on a single line for a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>In the next example we demonstrate centralizing power by combining it
before the Inline batteries, while decentralizing the battery backup by
letting each battery power its own circuit. This gives us the benefit of
convenience by combining all the power sources into a single line then
using Splitters to evenly divide that power between all batteries,</p>
<p><img src="images/ctr-pwr-dectr-bkp.png" /></p>
<p>or, like in the above picture, use an Electrical Branch to give
priority to 1 battery while evenly dividing the remaining power between
the other 2. This gives us the ability to prioritize batteries and also
take advantage of minimizing Active Usage per battery depending on the
circuit it is powering. This leads to a lower material and labor cost
and wastes less power.</p>
<p>Decentralizing the batteries is almost always the better option when
creating a hybrid circuit. While the above examples have used Inline
battery backups, in our 3rd example, we use a bypass battery backup
known as the Nih Core.</p>
<p><img src="images/decentnihcore.png" /></p>
<p>This battery backup is natively a centralized system but here, we
have decentralized the batteries by dedicating them to specific systems.
This is called the Decentralized Nih Core. We have combined the power
sources before sending power into the Nih Core. Instead of having the
batteries combined, which is traditional, we are instead separating the
batteries so they each only backup a smaller portion of the circuit. It
still gives us the benefit of powering our circuits the majority of the
time with a centralized main power source but it is also providing
security by decentralizing the battery backup. If the main power source
or the core is destroyed, the batteries will take over. If the main
power source or the core is not destroyed but a battery is, the circuit
will remain powered by the main power source. Only once both are
destroyed will a circuit go offline. If you want to build in some
prioritization, what circuit is last to kick on to the battery, you can
replace the Main Power Splitter with an Electrical Branch.</p>
<p><img src="images/hybrid2.png" /></p>
<p>Replacing the Splitter with an Electrical Branch allows you more
control over what circuit is the first to lose power and kick on to
battery vs the last to kick over to battery. On the Electrical Branch,
the output Branch Out lets you dedicate a specific amount of power to a
circuit while the output Power Out sends out the remaining amount. As
power falls, the circuit that is connected to Power Out will be the
first to lose main power and switch over to battery backup before the
circuit connected to Branch Out switches over to battery backup.</p>
<h1 id="distribution"><a href="#distribution"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Distribution</h1>
<p>Incomplete*</p>
<p>Centralized distribution is how 99.9% of all circuits are wired as
illustrated in the picture below. All end devices or circuits are fed
from a single source of power using a single battery backup following
the path of a single distributor.</p>
<p><img src="images/CentDist.png" /></p>
<p>Decentralized distribution at its simplest is using OR Switches
(outlined by purple in the picture below) to send power to each end
device (or circuit) from 2 or more power sources, battery backups or
distributors.</p>

<h1 id="wind-power"><a href="#wind-power" class="anchor-link">*</a>Wind
Power</h1>
<p>Generating power from the wind with Wind Turbines is the most common
way to generate rustricity. They are very reliable and can produce
anywhere from 0rW up to 150rW. Wind Turbine power is greatly influenced
by tower height to buildable ground and surrounding structures.</p>
<p>How close to a Wind Turbine is too close? That answer is 15 meters or
5 square foundations. Wind Turbines are large deployables and need a lot
of room. If something is blocking the path of the wind, the turbine will
produce zero power until the wind shifts direction. The picture below
shows an area called ‘Restricted Build Zone’. Building outside of this
area is completely safe. Building within the restricted zone could lead
to blocking the wind but if some precautions are taken.</p>
<p><img src="images/windbuildarea.png" /></p>
<p>Building within the restricted zone is possible and it’s easier than
people think. There is an invisible beam that sticks out the front of
the turbine, at the intersection of the blades. It is inline with the
horizontal drive shaft and sticks out 15 meters, or 5 square
foundations. If this beam gets blocked by something a player deploys or
builds, the turbine will stop spinning and stop producing power.</p>
<p><img src="images/windbuildbeam.png" /></p>
<p>This beam is not very thick and its height is just over 2 floors
high. As long as there are no obstructions out to 15 meters, the turbine
will continue to produce power. Obstructions are anything from building
structures to deployable items.This next picture shows where walls and
floors can be placed below the beam without interfering with power
production.</p>
<p><img src="images/windbuildrestrict.png" /></p>
<p>It is technically possible that something could be built in the area
that would be the 3rd floor, but floors can’t be suspended. Angled roofs
on the 2nd floor will block the wind because they stick up just enough
into the 3rd floor to block the beam.</p>
<p>The frame of double door frames will block the wind. The following
items can be placed into the double door frame and not block the wind. -
Chainlink Fence - Netting - Open Garage Door</p>
<p>This next picture shows a way to fully enclose the turbine inside a
building. The 2 requirements to do this are:<br />
1 - The 3rd floor needs to be free of obstructions out to 5 square
foundations.<br />
2 - Directly above the turbine needs to be 7 floors high.</p>
<p><img src="images/TurbineInside2.png" /></p>
<p><code>Fun fact</code>, the turbine always rotates clockwise and it
takes 1 hour to complete a full 360 degrees.</p>
<p><img src="images/windbuildrocation.png" /></p>
<p>Knowing how close to the Wind Turbine structures and deployables can
be placed is the first step. The next part is knowing how high they need
to be built. The higher a turbine is placed, the more power it will
produce on average. Height is referring to the distance between the
turbine and the buildable ground below it. This means there is no
difference between a turbine built on ground level at the beach or on
the top of a mountain. If they are built at the same height off the
ground, they will both produce the same amount of power. The next image
is showing us how much average power can be expected when it is built
above ground level.</p>
<p><img src="images/windbuildhight.png" /></p>
<p>When measuring height, people will regularly refer to how tall or
high their Wind Turbines are by counting the number of floors down to
the foundations. This is a very easy way to relay information to
everyone that plays Rust but if it was necessary to be more accurate,
the height of the foundation could be taken into account.</p>
<p><img src="images/windbuildfoundations.png" /></p>
<p>The strength of the wind varies over time. This means the amount of
power a Wind Turbine produces fluctuates up and down. It is the reason
why an average is used when talking about how much power a Wind Turbine
produces. To help illustrate this, in the picture below, the blue line
shows the amount of power a turbine at ground level was producing over
the period of an hour. It consists of approximately 180 data points. The
red line is what is said to be the average output for a turbine at
ground level.</p>
<p><img src="images/windaveragetime.png" /></p>
<p>The picture above is from a random hour and its purpose is to show
the randomness of wind. During this hour, the turbine’s max output was
only 113rW and its lowest output was 39rW. If this graph was stretched
out to 100+ hours, it would show that the most common fluctuations are
about 50rW + or - the average output. However, at some point, if the
graph was stretched out long enough, we would see the turbine max out
and produce 150rW. Likewise, we would also see its production drop to
0rW. The higher the turbine is, the more often it will max out at 150rW.
The lower the turbine is, the less often it will max out at 150rW. At
all heights, they have an equal chance to hit 0rW though it is very
rare. Due to this fluctuation, the most reliable thing to do was find
the average over a long period of time and that is how 93rW on the 6th
floor became the number that is used today.</p>
<p>If average output means that 50% of the time the turbine is producing
more or less power, then with the same data points, it’s also possible
to find out the amount of time a turbine will be producing a specific
amount of power or more for. For example, let’s say there was a need for
a turbine to produce 30rW but it had to produce that much 99.9% of the
time. How high would this turbine need to be? In this next picture,
there are examples of the 2nd, 6th and 9th floors. Using this data, a
turbine built 6 floors or more high, would be able to supply 30rW, 99.9%
of the time. If anyone would like to collect the data for the remaining
floors, I’d happily add it.</p>
<p><img src="images/unknown%20(3).png" /></p>
<p>Knowing this detailed information is not a necessity but if it is
understood, it will help prevent running out of power, or better yet,
being more efficient. Knowing how much power a circuit needs will help
determine how many turbines need to be built and at what height they
should be placed. The inverse of that is also true. If the number of
turbines and their height is limited, knowing how much power that can be
reliably produced will determine how big the circuit can be.</p>
<p>This next image is a very nice breakdown specifically for the Inline
battery backup. It shows the turbines average power per floor and the
usable amount of power from a battery. It also shows how many Auto
Turrets a single Wind Turbine and Large Battery combo could support. It
even shows how much stone each Rust Watt costs when building dedicated
Wind Turbine towers. The stone calculations are now a little low. There
was an update to the game that prevents turbines from being built on the
tops of double door frames. Now a floor is needed under them which adds
to the stone cost.</p>

<p>On Console: Point the panels South.</p>
<p>On PC: Depending on the time of year, the Sun will take a different
path through the sky. Most Rust players live in the northern hemisphere.
Places like Europe and North America. It is normal to have summers in
June and winters in December. Rust island is located in the southern
hemisphere, like Australia. This means winters are in June and summers
are in December.</p>
<ul>
<li>The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year. The Sun will
travel its most Northern path. On this day, the sunrise is the latest
and sunset is the earliest. During the winter months, solar panels
capture less power.</li>
<li>The summer solstice is the longest day of the year. The Sun will
travel its most Southern path. On this day, the sunrise is the earliest
and the sunset is the latest. During the summer months, solar panels
capture more power.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the picture below, it shows how the Sun will traverse the sky over
6 Rust months or 7ish real days. A day in the game is an hour of real
time. This means it takes about 15ish days for a full Rust Year.</p>
<p><img src="images/chart.png" /></p>
<p>Wipe day is always May 20th 2024. Depending how long or short the
wipe is, and where on the map a Solar Panel is located, might determine
the direction the Solar Panel is placed. If the wipe is 5 days or less
and the panel is located on the southern tip of the island, facing it
North would be acceptable. However, if the wipe is any longer than that,
the idea of having to pick up the panels to reangle them does not sound
like fun. Placing a panel facing East and a panel facing West is the
best way to set it and forget it.</p>
<p>Solar Panels will produce power when the face of the panel can see
the Sun. The Sun rises in the East and sets in the West. To take full
advantage of a Solar Panel, try to capture the Sun in the morning the
moment it rises above the horizon, and all the way to the moment the Sun
drops below the horizon at night. In order to accomplish this, line of
sight to each horizon is required.</p>
<p>Things like the ground, cliffs, trees and building structures can all
block the Sun. Avoid placing solar panels in their shadows. Solar Panels
need an unobstructed view of the Sun as much as possible. Deployables do
not appear to block the Sun.</p>
<p>The best chance of achieving line of sight to both horizons is by
building on top of the highest mountain. <img
src="images/SwiftMountain_Export_1.png" /> Otherwise, in the mornings,
Eastward facing panels on the West side of the map will need to wait for
the Sun to get high enough in the sky to clear the hills and mountains.
The panels on the East side could catch the sun the moment it peaks
above the horizon.</p>
<p><img src="images/SwiftMountain_Export_2.png" /> In the evenings,
Westward facinging panels on the East side of the map will have the
amount of time they could produce power cut short as the Sun moves
behind the hills and mountains. The panels on the West side could catch
the sun up to the moment it drops below the horizon.</p>
<p><img src="images/SwiftMountain_Export_3.png" /></p>
<p>Only an admin can get the exact date and time. This is what players
cannot see.</p>
<p><img src="images/admintool.png" /></p>
<p>Watching where the Sun rises and sets on the horizon can give a
player an idea of the time of year. Some modded servers will have a
plugin that gives players a clock and might show the sun up and down
times. Some might even show the date.</p>
<p>If a pair of panels are placed so each could see either the East or
West horizons, the following could reasonably be expected, within a
reasonable margin or error.</p>
<p><strong>The Winter Solstice (June 20 2024):</strong><br />
- Solar Panels facing East can start to capture the Sun around 7:10am.
Power levels will slowly increase until around 9:05am when they will be
producing a full 20rW. This lasts until about 1:30pm. Around this time,
it will slowly start decreasing power production until around 3:45pm
when it stops.<br />
- The panel facing West can start to capture the Sun around 11:40am. A
few minutes later at around 1:45pm, it will start producing a full 20rW.
Around 6:15pm the panel will start decreasing the amount of power
produced until about 8:15pm when it stops.<br />
- During the winter solstice, 2 combined panels, 1 facing East and 1
facing West, can collect around 940rWm of power.</p>
<p><strong>The Summer Solstice (December 21 2024):</strong><br />
- Solar Panels facing East can start to capture the Sun around 6:30am.
Power levels will slowly increase until around 8:20am when they will be
producing a full 20rW. This lasts until about 2:30pm. Around this time,
it will slowly start decreasing power production until around 4:15pm
when it stops. - The panel facing West can start to capture the Sun
around 11am. A few minutes later at around 1pm, it will start producing
a full 20rW. Around 7pm the panel will start decreasing the amount of
power produced until about 9pm when it stops. - During the summer
solstice, 2 combined panels, 1 facing East and 1 facing West, can
collect around 1075rWm of power.</p>
<p>When working with solar panels for a primary source of power, it is
very helpful to know how to calculate how much capacity a circuit needs
to last 1 in game day. Knowing the capacity will dictate how many panels
are needed. Base the number of panels used on the lowest amount of power
they will produce on the shortest day of the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Maths:</strong><br />
<code>rWm</code>: rust watt minutes (capacity)<br />
<code>rW</code>: Rust Watt (aka power)<br />
<code>S</code>: Seconds<br />
<code>τ</code>: 60 (The number of seconds in a minute, and minutes in an
hour)<br />
<code>M</code>: Minutes<br />
<code>O</code>: The amount of power(rW) you want to output<br />
<code>H</code>: Hours</p>
<p>To figure out how much capacity is needed to support a circuit of a
specific load, use the following equation:<br />
<code>O × τ = rWm</code></p>
<p>To figure out how many pairs of panels are needed to support a
specific amount to power, use the following equation:
<code>rWm ÷ 940rWm = Solar Panel pairs</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A circuit with an active load of 64rW.<br />
<code>O × τ = rWm</code><br />
<code>64 × 60 = 3840rWm</code><br />
Therefore a circuit needing a constant 64rW over the course of 1 hour
will consume 3840rWm worth of power.<br />
<code>rWm ÷ 940rW = Solar Panel pairs</code><br />
<code>3840rWm ÷ 940rW = 4.08</code><br />
Therefore 5 pairs of panels are needed to capture enough rWm to cover
the power cost of a 64rW circuit. 2 solar panels make a pair, so 10
panels total.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To figure out how much time a given capacity will run for, outputting
a specific amount of power, we use the following equations:
<code>Seconds: (rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>Minutes: rWm ÷ O = M</code><br />
<code>Hours: (rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H</code></p>

<h1 id="power-storage-1"><a href="#power-storage-1"

<p>TL:DR - Batteries can accept incoming power at the same time they are
sending power out.<br />
- Charging rate is dependent on the amount of power coming in, with an
efficiency of 80%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example:</em> 20rW from a Solar Panel × 0.8 = 16rW usable through
a battery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example:</em> If your Medium Battery is supplying 16rW to a
circuit, 16 ÷ 0.8 = 20rW is the minimum you want to give the battery so
it doesn’t lose any charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to supply slightly more than you need if you want
to charge the battery.<br />
</li>
<li>When you combine batteries with Root Combiners, they do not split
the load as one would expect. They cannot see each other, so each
battery tries to power the whole circuit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in a circuit with 2 root combined batteries supporting a
load of 50, it would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2
batteries equals 25 per battery. Rustricity doesn’t work like that and
50 power is taken from each battery and seen as Active Usage on both
batteries. This means both batteries are draining at a rate of 50.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all
the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage, which is used to
calculate how fast a battery drains.<br />
So if we are forcing batteries to max drain, then we might as well try
to use as much of the power the combined batteries will provide.</p>
<p>When using a bypass battery backup like the <a
href="powerstorage.html#nih-core">Nih core</a>, Active Usage does not
matter because the circuits are getting power from the main power source
most of the time and not the battery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rustricity has its own version of <a
href="powerstorage.html#parallel-vs-series">Parallel and Series</a>
battery configurations.</li>
<li>1rw will charge a Large Battery in 34 IRL days.</li>
<li>When a battery is depleted because it is not receiving enough power,
no power is outputed until it charges up for a couple seconds before
outputting to the connected circuit. The battery still not receiving
enough power will deplete in a second and the process repeats.<br />
</li>
<li>If the circuit after a battery is turning on and off, you do not
have enough power charging your batteries.</li>
<li>When they get picked up, they lose 25% HP but retain their current
capacity. This means if a large battery has a full charge, when you pick
it up and place it back down, it will still have a full charge.</li>
<li>Batteries have something called Active Usage and components have
something called Power Consumption. Read about it in <a

<h1 id="battery-backup"><a href="#battery-backup"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Battery Backup</h1>
<p>There are 3 types of battery backup systems. There are Inline
Backups, there are Bypass Backups and then there are the Battery Checked
Backups of both Inline and Bypass. Inline backups include the Inline
while The Kore is Battery Checked. Bypass backups include the OR/Blocker
and the Nih Core while the BCN Core is Battery Checked.</p>
<p>Deciding which backup to use really comes down to preference. They
each have their own pros and cons and some may argue that 1 is better
than another in different situations. For example, if you only need to
power a few turrets and are in a hurry, you might find the simplicity of
the Inline backup works for you. Maybe you are working with 300rW to
1000rW and a dozen Windmills, you might find the efficiency of the Nih
Core is preferred. Having a good understanding of the concept Active
Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed will also help you decide on a backup. At
the end of the day, as long as the battery backup you go with, works
when you need it to work, that was the right backup to choose.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="direct-delivery"><a href="#direct-delivery"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Direct Delivery</h1>
<p><img src="images/image86.png" /></p>
<p>This is when the power source is directly connected to a circuit. If
the power source is destroyed or stops producing power for any reason,
the circuit will go offline. This method is a great solution for short
term uses like getting some auto turrets asap for your clan or getting
some water pumps online early for a berry farm. While this method is
good for a very short time to get an early game advantage, it is not
recommended to rely on this method for any length of time. Introducing
batteries to a circuit to create backup power is more suited for long
term use.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to wire</li>
<li>Minimal components</li>
<li>Early game advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If power source is destroyed the components turn off</li>
<li>No backup power</li>
<li>Short term use only</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="inline"><a href="#inline" class="anchor-link">*</a>Inline</h1>
<p><img src="images/image26.png" /></p>
<p>This is called an Inline because power must pass through the battery
before powering something. Inline batteries are the most common and
easiest way to provide a battery backup. This method is fast to make and
wire. It is reliable assuming enough power is being produced to keep the
batteries charged. It is also an easy way to decentralize circuits. When
a power source is directly connected to a battery, 100% of that power is
used for the sole purpose of charging that battery. When a battery is
fully charged, any power above what is needed to maintain the battery’s
charge, is not being used, which we call wasted.</p>
<p>Batteries are 80% efficient and have a mechanic called Active Usage.
There is an entire section about this but for right now, to figure out
how much power a battery must be given so it doesnt drain, take the
Active Usage number and divide that by 0.8. Active Usage can be found by
holding a Wire Tool and looking at a battery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a large battery with an Active Usage of 100. 100 ÷ 0.8 =
125. Therefore, 125rW needs to be provided to prevent the battery from
draining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the battery is being given 150rW so it charges, when it is fully
charged, there is 25rW of power that is not being used. When it needs to
be charged, that 25rW is better then 1rW because it will charge faster.
Giving a Large Battery only 1rW, it will take roughly 34 IRL days to
fully charge. For 1 battery, 25 extra doesn’t seem like a lot, but when
using 4 or more batteries, that can be 100rW of power being
“wasted”.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of an Inline backup is when the power
source stops making enough or any electricity, the battery will continue
to supply power, uninterrupted. This means that unlike bypass backs, the
inline is not prone to a flicker off/on when the power source is not
producing enough power. The battery will continue to power the circuit
until it is depleted or destroyed.</p>
<p>It is recommended to start charging batteries as soon as possible.
Let them charge to a minimum of 3000rWm before letting them power
anything. The reason for this is if a Wind Turbine is used, the wind
could be entering a slow period. When using Solar Panels, night comes
once an hour. Having some capacity saved up will help get through the
slow or no times.</p>

Kore</h1>
<p><img src="images/thekorenolight.png" /></p>
<p>This is an upgraded Inline battery backup. It is a battery checked
Inline backup, aka The Kore. Just like the traditional Inline, power
from the main power source is used to charge the battery. The battery
still powers the circuit all of the time just like an Inline backup, but
if the battery gets destroyed, The Kore will switch over to the Wind
Turbine or main power source. This is a huge advantage over the
traditional Inline.</p>
<p>As The Kore is using an inline battery, paying attention to Active
Usage is required. Active Usage can be found by holding a Wire Tool and
looking at the battery. There is a section that goes into detail about
Active Usage but for now, just know that the amount of power an inline
system needs is the Active Usage number ÷ by 0.8 (or Active Usage number
× 1.25). This is because batteries are 80% efficient. The number that is
given from doing this math is the minimum amount of power the battery
will require to not drain. Adding more than that number allows the
battery to charge.</p>
<p>The way this system works is by sending power to a Memory Cell first.
The left output, <code>Inverted Output</code>, is connected to an OR
Switch that connects to a circuit. Power moves through the right side
output, <code>Output</code>, to an Electrical Branch. 2 power is
branched off to <code>RESET</code> on the Memory Cell and the rest is
used to charge the battery. Power from the battery is sent to an
Electrical Branch where 2 is branched off to ‘SET’ on the Memory Cell
and the rest is sent to the OR Switch which powers the circuit. Due to
how side inputs on the Memory Cell work, while <code>SET</code> is
getting power, it will always send power through the right side output.
If the battery is destroyed, power is removed from <code>SET</code>
while power is still going to <code>RESET</code> which causes the Memory
Cell to flip outputs. This allows the attached circuit to still receive
some power which is better than no power.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this backup system is the ability to
continue to send power to the circuit even after the battery is
destroyed, no matter how much power is coming in. It is recommended to
let the battery charge to a minimum of 3000rWm before letting it power
anything providing a buffer when entering a low power protection period
of time.</p>

<p><img src="images/ORblocker.png" /></p>
<p>This method has been around for a long time and is often called
‘Infinite Power’. It is not infinite power, it is just a bypass battery
backup. It has been carried over from a previous version of electricity
when batteries could only charge or discharge, not both at the same
time. During this time batteries did not have an Active Usage and forced
out max power causing the need to invent the ‘Infinite Power Loop’,
which actually was something, but it was not this circuit.</p>
<p>This is an OR/Blocker battery backup. It is a bypass battery backup
that powers a circuit most of the time from the main power source. Power
is bypassing the battery to power the circuit, while the excess power is
used to charge the battery. When not enough power is produced, it will
automatically switch on the battery keeping everything powered. The
reason it is now considered out of date is because it doesn’t take
advantage of the batteries ability to charge and discharge at the same
time.</p>
<p>The way this method works is by sending power into the first
Electrical Branch and branching out enough power to meet a circuit’s
needs. That power is passed to an OR Switch which sends power to a
circuit. The extra electricity from the first Electrical Branch is sent
to another Electrical Branch. Power is branched out to block the Blocker
which prevents the battery from draining. The extra power is then used
to charge the battery. When there is not enough power to keep the
battery blocked, the battery sends power out to the OR Switch to keep
the circuit online.</p>
<p>Based on the picture below, green wire showing what has power, red
showing no power and yellow showing wasted power. If the Windmill only
produces 75 power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the
first</p>
<p><img src="images/orblockerstates.png" /> Electrical Branch or block
the battery. The battery takes over powering the circuit but the 75
power is still coming out of the first Electrical Branch. The power is
still there, it is just not being used, it is wasted.</p>
<p>While considered out of date today for use as a primary battery
backup system, with some small modifications, it is useful as a
secondary battery backup which we talk about in its own section.</p>

<li>Simple to build</li>

<h1 id="nih-core"><a href="#nih-core" class="anchor-link">*</a>Nih
Core</h1>
<p><img src="images/image87.png" /></p>
<p>The Nih Core is the modern version of, and replacement for, the
OR/Blocker. When using an inline battery to power a circuit, there is a
20% loss due to the batteries inefficiency. Bypass battery backups, like
the Nih Core, are a way around this. Instead of a circuit being powered
by the battery, the circuit gets power directly from the Wind Turbine
while the battery gets charged with the excess. The Nih Core will
automatically switch over to the backup battery when the power source is
not producing enough.</p>
<p>The Nih Core becomes more efficient the more batteries it has but
there is only 1 in the picture because it’s all that is needed to
demonstrate how the Nih Core functions. The simple explanation is when
there is not enough power to meet a circuit’s requirements, it redirects
the insufficient amount of power to the battery and activates it to take
over powering the circuit. The reason the Nih Core becomes more
efficient with more batteries is because we are bypassing the 20% hit
from an inline battery and we don’t care about the battery’s Active
Usage. We are bypassing the battery therefore removing any restrictions
or conditions caused by it. Check out the section called ‘Battery Active
Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed’ for an in depth explanation.</p>
<p>Using the following picture, it is possible to see where power exists
and where it doesn’t when the Nih Core is running off of Main Power vs
Battery Power. The green wires have power and the red wires do not.</p>
<p><img src="images/nih-core-paths.png" /></p>
<p>To understand how this works, becoming familiar with the Memory Cell
and the Splitter will help a lot. The inputs on the side of the Memory
Cell are prioritized from top to bottom and when the Splitter receives
power, it sends out power from left to right. This also applies to when
Splitters lose power, they stop sending power out from left to right.
The section ‘Circuit Delay and Power Flow’ helps explain in detail how
rustricity moves around a circuit.</p>
<p>Based on the picture above, if the windmill only produces 75rW of
power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first Electrical
Branch, which is set to 100. That first Electrical Branch will still
send that 75rW to the Memory Cell. This means no power is going to the
second Electrical Branch, therefore the Splitter loses power. When the
Splitter loses power, Output 1 first stops sending power to SET on the
Memory Cell. At that moment, power from Output 2 is still going to
RESET, so the Memory Cell flips outputs. RESET loses power followed by
Output 3 going to Block Passthrough on the Blocker. The battery then
takes over powering the circuit. The 75rW of power that is still going
through the first Electrical Branch and Memory Cell, is now sent to the
battery extending its life instead of being wasted. This will take a 4
hour backup time and extend it.</p>
<p><img src="images/ctr-nih-core.png" /></p>
<p>Here is a look at a Nih Core with 4 batteries. Keep in mind Max Depth
when using large numbers of power sources and batteries. 16 power
sources and 16 batteries is the most you can connect before hitting the
Max Depth. Check out the section ‘Short Circuit / Max Depth’ for an in
depth explanation on that subject.</p>
<p>If you notice that power is flickering off/on when switching between
main power and battery power, it is because 1 of 2 issues.</p>
<p><img src="images/nihcoresolutions.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution 1 -</strong> If using only 1 battery, add a Root
Combiner between the battery and blocker to keep the battery active. If
the battery does not have something registering Active Usage, it will
enter an inactive state. This causes a delay when switching on to
battery power waiting for the battery to wake up.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2 -</strong> If already using a Root Combiner or
using more than 1 battery, add 1 or 2, maybe even 3 components between
the Memory Cells ‘Output’ and the OR Switch. This will hold power here
longer giving the circuit a chance to receive power from the
battery.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 3 -</strong> Use a secondary inline battery backup
to buffer against the flicker on circuits that need stability. In the
picture below, the purple wires are representing a destruction detection
system on some walls. Then the flicker happens, the Smart Alarm gets
triggered. Adding the battery prevents that from happening. It does cost
20% more power for that circuit because of the battery, but it is 100%
stable. The yellow wires represent circuits that do not need 100%
stability. It could be deemed acceptable if these circuits turn off and
on once in a while.</p>

<h1 id="secondary-battery-backup"><a href="#secondary-battery-backup"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Secondary Battery Backup</h1>
<p>A secondary battery backup is used to provide power to a circuit
after the main backup system goes offline. It’s a backup of a backup.
The chance that a secondary backup battery gets used on a typical day is
near 0%, so why use them? Why not? The only drawback is the increased
power cost. More backups and redundancy never hurts functionality, it
only adds to it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different versions of the secondary backup.
Just like primary battery backups, there is the inline and the bypass.
Secondary backups can be built into any place in any circuit.</p>
<p>The first and easiest way is installing an inline battery between a
circuit and its power bus. Let’s use a picture to illustrate a circuit
that is using a Nih Core as a primary battery backup with Inline
batteries for the secondary backup.</p>
<p><img src="images/secbatbkup.png" /></p>
<p>The secondary batteries are installed between the Electrical Branches
and what the branch is providing power to. In the case of the Auto
Turrets, instead of the Electrical Branch sending power straight to the
Smart Switch, the branch sends power to a battery that then powers the
switch and all the turrets. It’s the same for the SAM Sites. Power from
the branch powers a battery and the battery powers the SAMs. Remembering
that batteries are only 80% efficient, the amount of power each
Electrical Branch provides is increased to compensate. With a secondary
battery, the branch sending power to the turrets is set to 115. Without
the secondary, it only needs to be set to 99. That’s a 16rW difference.
The branch sending power to the SAM Sites is set to 96 but without the
secondary battery, it only needs to be set to 76. That’s a 20rW
difference. For a total cost of 36rW, both the turrets and the SAMs will
have a runtime of 8 or more hours if the main power source is completely
destroyed.</p>
<p>Another thing that should not be forgotten is that it takes 34ish
days, or over 800 hours, to charge a large battery with only 1rW. In
other words, precharging secondary batteries should be a requirement.
Once a battery is fully charged, providing it with any more then exactly
what it needs to not drain, is wasted power that could maybe be better
used elsewhere. The maximum input a battery can accept is 4x its output.
That means 400rW could be sent to a large battery and have it fully
charged in approximately 1 hour 15ish minutes.</p>
<p>The inline secondary battery is the easiest but paying the 20% tax
for the battery can make this version not so attractive. So let’s have a
look at a bypass secondary backup which has a static tax of only 3rW.
This is essentially an OR/Blocker backup except the battery gets
installed precharged and there is no built in way for it to be
recharged. Let’s use the picture below to help illustrate how it
works.</p>
<p><img src="images/secorblk.png" /></p>
<p>The Test Generator represents static power coming from your main
battery backup system. This means power levels won’t go up or down like
wind and solar. When the Electrical Branch loses just 1rW, the battery
will take over. What is more likely is that power will either be present
or it will not. This battery should never be used so there is no built
in recharging system. This saves wasting power recharging a battery that
will probably never be used so it must be precharged.</p>
<p>This secondary backup gets installed just like the inline version,
between the circuit and its power bus. The picture below illustrates the
same circuit as before using a Nih Core as a primary battery backup but
now with a bypass battery for the secondary backup.</p>
<p><img src="images/secbatbkup2.png" /></p>
<p>The secondary batteries are installed between the Electrical Branches
and what the branch is providing power to. In the case of the Auto
Turrets, instead of the Electrical Branch sending power straight to the
Smart Switch. Power is sent to another Electrical Branch that blocks
passthrough on a Blocker before sending a specific amount of power on an
OR Switch. From there, it’s on to the Smart Switch and all the turrets.
It’s the same for the SAM Sites. Power from the branch goes to another
Electrical Branch that blocks a Blocker before sending power to an OR
Switch. From there it’s off to power the SAMs.</p>
<p>The ability to bypass the battery means the amount of power each
Electrical Branch provides only needs to be increased by 3rW to
compensate. With a secondary battery, the branch sending power to the
turrets is set to 98. Without the secondary, it only needs to be set to
95. That’s a 3rW difference. The branch sending power to the SAM Sites
is set to 79 but without the secondary battery, it only needs to be set
to 76. That’s also a 3rW difference. For a total cost of only 6rW, both
the turrets and the SAMs will have a runtime of 8 or more hours if the
main power source is completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Adding a recharging system can be done. It is just the OR/Blocker
battery backup. The only drawback is the added power cost. If a player
is OK with that, then go for it.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses only a few components so it’s easy to build and wire</li>
<li>Can be efficient for redundant backup power</li>
<li>Can be inserted into almost any circuit at any point</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires a pre charged battery</li>
<li>Added costs for redundancy  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed"><a
href="#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Battery Active Usage VS Actual Power
Consumed</h1>
<p>Simply put, Active Usage is what a battery uses to calculate its
charge and discharge rate. Power consumed is the amount of power a
component requires to operate. Active Usage doesn’t always = Power
Consumed. This is also where the argument of Electrical Branch vs
Splitter comes from. Once you understand this section, you will know the
answer to this age-old argument.</p>
<p>When you look at the battery with a wire tool, you will see Active
Usage. Active Usage is the amount of power the battery is draining by.
This is the number you want to use when calculating how much power to
give a battery for it to remain charged based on the battery’s 80%
efficiency. Active Usage ÷ 0.8 or Active Usage × 1.25 gives you the
minimum power input to remain neutral.</p>
<p><img src="images/large-battery-ui.png" /></p>
<p>It is reasonable to think that the number you see is the amount of
power your circuit is currently consuming, but it’s not always the case.
Even when some components are turned off and not consuming power, they
can still add to a battery’s Active Usage. In this next picture, even
though the Auto Turret is not consuming power, it is still adding to the
battery’s</p>
<p><img src="images/turned-off-usage.png" /></p>
<p>Active Usage and in fact, it will actually consume 14 power. In this
case even though the AND Switch is not allowing power to pass through,
it does not have the ability to hide the Active Usage from inactive
components downstream or past it. In this next picture, if we use
different components to achieve the same outcome, we can hide</p>
<p><img src="images/hide-active-usage.png" /></p>
<p>the Auto Turret’s Active Usage from the battery when it is not
consuming power. This setup reduces the Active Usage all the way to 6.
When active, we will get an Active Usage of 16 but it will actually
consume 18.<br />
Components like Switches, the Blocker, Timer and RF Transmitter all have
the ability to hide a component’s Active Usage from batteries when not
passing power through.</p>
<p>Every component will only register an Active Usage once and equal to
the amount of power it consumes with the exception of the Electrical
Branch. Only the Branch Out value will register Active Usage even though
it does consume 1 power for itself. An Electrical Branch set to 2 will
register an Active Usage of 2 but will consume 3. Branch Out is a FIXED
value. The thing to remember is that it is the Branch Out value that is
registering Active Usage, not the components connected to Branch Out.
This means that the components connected to Branch Out, even though it
is where they are getting their power from, their Active Usage is not
what is registering on the battery. If there is another path that lets
the battery see these components, it is possible for their Active Usage
to register on the battery along with the Branch Out value, effectively
doubling the power needed. This next picture is a quick example to show
how a Boom Box that is powered from Branch Out, but using a Switch to
Toggle Play on and off, is registering 10 Active Usage for the Branch
Out, 1 for the Switch and 10 for the Boom Box. If we do the same thing,
but with the Splitter, we dont have this issue because the Splitter
controls its power flow DYNAMICALLY. <img
src="images/branch-vs-splitter-active-usage-onoff.png" /></p>
<p>This is helpful in situations where you have a few small circuits
where you dont want to force an Active Usage when the circuits are off.
Now because the Electrical Branch only registers the Branch Out value as
Active Usage and 0 for itself, we can trick batteries into thinking less
power is being consumed. In the next picture, we have some examples
using Auto Turrets. <img
src="images/active-usage-vs-pwr-consuption-turret.png" /></p>
<p>Above, we have 1 example using 8 Electrical Branches to power 9 Auto
Turrets. Every branch is outputting 10 power but also consuming 1 power
for itself. So in total we are consuming 98 power but the battery’s
Active Usage is only 90. The 2nd example we are using 4 Splitters to
power the same number of turrets only this time the Splitters are
consuming 1 and have an Active Usage of 1 each. This gives us an Active
Usage and Power Consumption of 94. The example with Electrical Branches
only has 2 extra power meaning there is enough power available to add a
single Ceiling Light while the 2nd example has 6 extra power, that’s
enough power for 3 Ceiling Lights.</p>
<p>In the situation where an Inline Battery is being used, you want to
minimize the battery’s Active Usage to minimize the cost of power
production. Like in the single Auto Turret examples above, there is a
required input power difference of 9rW just to maintain the battery.
Batteries are 80% efficient. Take the Active Usage number and divide it
by 0.8. This will give you the minimum amount of power required to
maintain the battery and it will not drain. It wont charge either. The
more power above the minimum, the faster the battery will charge but the
more you will waste when the battery is full. 1rW will charge a large
battery but it will take 34 IRL days.</p>
<p>In a bypass system like the Nih Core, Active Usage doesn’t matter
because you are not relying on the battery as a main power source. You
are bypassing the battery. This means that the amount of power consumed
is more important. If we look at the above picture again with the 9 Auto
Turrets, we can see that while both examples are accomplishing the same
goal, 1 is consuming less power then the other. If we look back at the
single Auto Turret examples, the 1st example with an Active Usage of 13
will actually consume 14 vs the 2nd with an Active Usage of 6 will
actually consume 18. So while the 1st example is bad on an Inline
system, it is better in a bypass system. The less power you can use to
do something, gives you more power to do other things.</p>
<p>You can use a bypass system with 1 Large Battery and only use 50
power to double the life of the battery but, it is more common to see a
bypass system used for 2 or more batteries to get a larger output. If we
are using 2 or more batteries to get the higher output, a Root Combiner
will be used. The moment we combine batteries to power a circuit that
uses more than 100 power, both batteries will have an Active Usage of
100. This is because load sharing is not a thing in Rustricity. If the
circuit only needs 50, both batteries will have an Active Usage of
50(plus 1 for the Root Combiner).</p>
<p><img src="images/root-combined-batterys.png" /></p>
<p>Due to this being the way it is, if you combine 2 batteries to get
200 power, try to use all 200 because no matter if the circuit needs 101
or 199, 2 large batteries will only last 4 hours. If they are only going
to last 4 hours regardless, try to use as much of that 200 as possible
to make it worth combining the batteries. Otherwise, split the circuit,
run Inlines and minimize the Active Usage.</p>
<p>Now, having said you want to consume as little power as possible to
achieve the desired outcome when using a bypass battery backup, there
are times when it is worth consuming more for a bit of added security.
In the next picture, Ive used medium batteries for the demonstration,
and they are root combined powering some Auto Turrets.</p>
<p><img src="images/power-bus-security-compared-turrets.png" /></p>
<p>The top groups are using Electrical Branches. They are consuming more
power but in the event 1 battery is destroyed, top right, some turrets
stay active. The bottom groups use Splitters. While they do consume less
power, in the event a battery is lost, very bottom, all the turrets go
offline. You will need to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is
right to fit your needs. Read more in What is a Power Bus?</p>
<h1 id="parallel-vs-series"><a href="#parallel-vs-series"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Parallel vs Series</h1>
<p>Lets start by learning what Parallel and Series means in real life.
Connecting batteries in series increases voltage and connecting
batteries in parallel increases capacity.</p>
<p>V = Volts (power)<br />
Ah = Amp hour (capacity)</p>
<p>If we wire two 6V@10Ah batteries in parallel, we will still only have
6V but have 20Ah of capacity.<br />
If we wire two 6V@10Ah batteries in series, we will now have twice the
power at 12V but with only 10Ah of capacity.</p>
<p><img src="images/paravssers.png" /></p>
<p>In real life, batteries have positive (+) and negative (-)
connections. In Rust, our batteries only have 1 input and 1 output. We
also measure our Volts (V) as Rust Watts (rW) and our capacity, instead
of Amp hours (Ah) we use Rust Watt Minutes (rWm).</p>
<p>In Rust, a large battery can give 100rW of power and has a capacity
of 24000rWm. The outcome of wiring 2 large batteries in series would be
200rW of power with a capacity of 24000rWm. The outcome of wiring 2
large batteries in parallel would be 100rW of power with a capacity of
48000rWm.</p>
<h2 id="series"><a href="#series" class="anchor-link">*</a>Series</h2>
<p>To wire large batteries in series in Rust, just use a Root Combiner.
The output will be 200rW and because both batteries will drain at the
same, the total capacity will remain at 24000rWm. This will give a
mimimum runtime of 4 hours.</p>
<p><img src="images/series1.png" /></p>
<p>Wiring more than 2 batteries into series is not much more
complicated. Just add more Root Combiners. This will provide more power
for consumption but the capacity will remain the same. For more
information as to why the capacity stays the same, it is recommended
reading <a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Battery
Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumption</a> in the Power Storage
section under Concepts.</p>
<p><img src="images/series2.png" /></p>
<p>It is recommended to charge all the batteries wired in series at the
same rate. This will help keep power levels equal across all batteries.
For example, if there are 2 batteries in series and 1 of them drains
empty, 50% of the circuit will go offline because 50% of the power is
gone. However, giving priority to 1 battery in series could be a design
feature.</p>
<h2 id="parallel"><a href="#parallel"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Parallel</h2>
<p>To wire 2 large batteries in parallel requires a few more components.
1 battery needs to block the other battery to prevent both from draining
at the same time. The output is only 95rW because of the extra
components but the capacity will be doubled to 48000rWm. This would
provide a minimum runtime of 8 hours.</p>
<p><img src="images/parallel.png" /></p>
<p>While this technically works for paralleling 2 batteries, consider
using a secondary backup instead. 2 parallel batteries costs 5rW but a
bypass secondary backup could cost as little as 2rW. This can also be
true no matter the number of secondary batteries if there is no built in
recharging. If recharging a secondary battery is built in, it adds a
minimum of 2rW per battery to the power cost. Check out the section for
<a href="powerstorage.html#secondary-battery-backup">Secondary
Backups</a> in Power Storage under Concepts.</p>
<p>Going beyond 2 batteries and tripling the capacity, things get a
little more complicated.</p>

measured in Rust Watt Minutes (rWm).</p>
<p>Contrarily, in a Capacitor, we gauge the power storage by examining
an Input/Output (IO) connection and observing a figure that is typically
associated with <code>power</code> or the amount of power available for
use.<br />
But within the Capacitor, this figure <strong>DOES NOT indicate the
amount of power that can be utilized</strong>. Rather, this figure is
what we call <code>Wire Capacity</code>, symbolized as <code>Np</code>.
For instance, in the image below, the displayed <code>6,492,076</code>
is <strong>NOT</strong> the amount of power available. Instead, it
represents <code>6,492,076Np</code> of Wire Capacity.</p>
<p><img src="images/capacitor2.png" /></p>
<p>Before going into the construction and operation of a Capacitor, it’s
essential to understand the math conversions between Rust Watt Minutes
(rWm) and Wire Capacity (Np).</p>
<p>Both represent capacity, but they use different units of measurement
depending on the energy storage container, be it a battery or a
capacitor.</p>
<p><strong>The Maths:</strong><br />
<code>rWm :</code> rust watt minutes (capacity)<br />
<code>rW :</code> rust watts (commonly referred to as “power”)<br />
<code>Np :</code> Wire Capacity<br />
<code>∅ :</code> 7.5 (Trust Me Bro)<br />
<code>S :</code> Seconds<br />
<code>τ :</code> 60 (The number of seconds in a minute, and minutes in
an hour)<br />
<code>M :</code> Minutes<br />
<code>P :</code> Max power output for 1 second<br />
<code>O :</code> The amount of power you want to output<br />
<code>H :</code> Hours</p>
<p>To convert rWm into Wire Capacity(Np), use the following
equation:<br />
<code>(rWm × τ = P) × ∅ = Np</code></p>
<p>To convert Wire Capacity(Np) into rWm, use the following
equation:<br />
<code>(Np ÷ ∅ = P) ÷ τ = rWm</code></p>
<p>To figure out how much time a given capacity will run for outputting
a specific amount of power, use the following equations:<br />
<code>Seconds: (rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>Minutes: rWm ÷ O = M</code><br />
<code>Hours: (rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H</code></p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />
Using Capacity from the battery in the first picture, it is possible to
figure out the number that would be seen if looking at an IO connection
in a Capacitor to view Wire Capacity(Np).<br />
<code>(rWm × τ = P) × ∅ = Np</code><br />
<code>(271 × 60 = 16,260) × 7.5 = 121,950Np</code></p>
<p>Therefore a capacity of 271rWm when viewed on an IO connection is
equal to 121,950Np. We can also see that if the Large Battery did not
have an output limit of 100, it would be able to output 16,260rW of
power for 1 second.</p>
<p>Using the IO connection to view Wire Capacity(Np) from the second
picture, it is possible to figure out how much rWm of Capacity we would
have if this was viewed on a battery.<br />
<code>(Np ÷ ∅ = P) ÷ τ = rWm</code><br />
<code>(6,492,076 ÷ 7.5 = 865,610.1333) ÷ 60 = 14,426rWm</code></p>
<p>Therefore a Wire Capacity of 6,492,076Np when viewed on a battery
represented as Capacity, it is equal to 14,426rWm.</p>
<p>Without a limited output, the Capacitor is capable of delivering
865,610rW of power for 1 second.</p>
<p>Using both of these examples, it’s possible to calculate the length
of time both the Battery and Capacitor would power a circuit for, given
a set output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our example, let’s say the circuit needs 100 power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Battery :<br />
<code>(rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>(271 ÷ 100 = 2.71 Minutes) × 60 = 162 Seconds</code></p>
<p>Capacitor : <em>(you will need to convert from Np to rWm
first)</em><br />
<code>(rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>(14,426 ÷ 100 = 144.26 Minutes) × 60 = 8,655 Seconds</code></p>
<p>OR :<br />
<code>(rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H</code><br />
<code>(14,426 ÷ 100 = 144.26 Minutes) ÷ 60 = 2.40 Hours</code></p>
<p>Prior to constructing a capacitor, it’s crucial to understand its
limitations and potential issues. This will clarify misconceptions such
as the notion of ‘infinite power’ and help identify the appropriate
contexts for its use.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t survive server restarts. evrytime the server restarts,
all of the stored power will vanish, poof gone.<br />
</li>
<li>When automating energy extraction, it is possible that a flicker
will be created or worse, all the power vanishes, poof gone.</li>
<li>It consumes power even when nothing is connected to it, unlike a
battery that doesn’t lose power if nothing is connected to it.</li>
<li>It is not portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some of the advantages and benefits of the Capacitor</p>
<hr />
<p>That wraps up this section. I hope I have explained things in a way
that makes sense. Please comment on the <a

<h1 id="what-is-a-power-bus"><a href="#what-is-a-power-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>What is a Power Bus?</h1>
<p><img src="images/image127.png" /></p>
<p>Power always needs a way to get from point A to point B. That could
be from a Wind Turbine to an Auto Turret or from a Solar Panel to a
Light. A power bus is a single or group of components with the sole
purpose of directing the flow of electricity to different circuits that
perform specific tasks such as auto turrets or lighting. This is a lot
like the breaker panel or fuse panel you have in your home for your
electricity. Each breaker or fuse is dedicated for a specific room or
purpose, like the fridge, furnace, bedrooms or garage. These breakers or
fuses limit how much power each circuit can use and in Rust, this is no
different. Instead of breakers or fuses, its Electrical Branches and
Splitters.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of deciding how to distribute power is
knowing how the components that are specifically made for this job
function. There are 2 main components, the Electrical Branch and the
Splitter and its recommended reading about them specifically in the
Power Distribution section under Component Details. There are 3 types of
power buses, fixed, dynamic and configurable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fixed-bus-f-bus"><a href="#fixed-bus-f-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Fixed Bus (F-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image115.png" /></p>
<p>A fixed bus, known as an F-Bus, is when you dedicate a specific
amount of power per output. This can be just a single Electrical Branch
or a group of them. This type of power bus always consumes the amount of
power each output is set to, even if nothing is attached to Branch Out.
This will affect Inline battery backups by forcing an Active Usage and
it will affect a bypass battery backup by always consuming power, even
when the components connected to Branch Out are offline.</p>
<p>A fixed bus is an easy way to build in priorities and a bit of
security. The first Electrical Branch has the highest priority because
it’s the first to get power and in the event that power levels start
falling, it will be the last branch to lose power. The security comes
from knowing that if 50% of the power supply disappears, only some
branches will lose power and not all.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dynamic-bus-d-bus"><a href="#dynamic-bus-d-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Dynamic Bus (D-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image51.png" /></p>
<p>A dynamic bus, known as a D-Bus, is when the components evenly
distribute power between all connected outputs. This can be just a
single Splitter or a group of them and the only control over the amount
of power available at each output is the amount of power that is put
into it.</p>
<p>This is great when the component or circuit attached to each output
requires the same amount of power. It is a power efficient way to supply
the same amount of power to multiple components or circuits. When using
a bypass battery backup, it can free up some power to be used somewhere
else. When using an Inline battery backup, only the Active Usage from
the Splitter is forced onto the battery. Only when the components
connected to each output are online will their Active Usage be reflected
on the battery. This is good in situations where a player wants to use a
Switch to turn things off before they logout.</p>
<p>If an output gets destroyed, the system will evenly redistribute
power between the remaining outputs. The drawback would be that if the
incoming power drops too low to support the connected outputs,
everything will stop working or at least those that require the full
amount of power that was previously present.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="configure-siphon-c-bus"><a href="#configure-siphon-c-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Configure Siphon (C-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/multi-c-bus.png" /></p>
<p>A configure siphon, known as a C-Bus, is a bypass distributor that is
only active when required. The idea is only when power is needed will
the C-Bus become active, otherwise the power just passes through. Set
the Electrical Branches in the siphon to a specific amount of power to
only be used when the siphon is active. There are multiple versions of
the siphon based on if there is a need for manual or automatic operation
and what kind of battery backup is being used.</p>
<p>All of them are centered around the Memory Cell. The Memory Cell has
2 outputs, Output and Inverted Output. One output is called the Main
Line (aka the bypass) and the other output goes to the Circuit that we
want to power. The Main Line is the default path the electricity takes
when the siphon is not active. It will pass from a Memory Cell to an OR
Switch and out. The Circuit path is the route electricity will take when
the Memory Cell gets triggered. It gets sent to an Electrical Branch
that is configured to an amount of power the circuit needs while the
remainder gets sent off to the OR Switch and back onto the Main Line to
continue powering the circuits past it. While this is the general
concept, let’s get a little more specific.</p>
<p>There are <strong>2 categories</strong> of Configure Siphons. There
is the <strong>Auto Reset</strong> which will automatically turn itself
on when an input is received and off when the input signal is removed.
The second is <strong>Manual</strong> which requires a player to
manually turn it on and off. Within each of these categories there are
<strong>2 types</strong>. There is the <strong>Standard C-Bus</strong>
which is to be used in a circuit that uses a bypass battery backup like
the <a href="powerstorage.html#nih-core">Nih Core</a>. The second type
is the Blocked C-Bus meant to be used in a circuit that uses an <a
href="powerstorage.html#nih-core">Inline</a> battery backup. The reason
1 has a Blocker is because of the nature of components and a battery’s
Active Usage. The Blocker has the ability to hide Active Usage from a
battery when it is actively being blocked. Read more about that in the
section titled <a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Battery
Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumption</a> located in Power Storage
under Concepts.</p>
<p>Now to get very specific. Starting with the Auto Reset siphons, these
by default will send power out the Inverted Output(left output). Power
will be passed to an OR Switch then out. In the Blocked version, power
gets passed to an Electrical Branch that is used to block a Blocker
before passing power to the OR Switch and out. ‘Out’ could be another
siphon, another type of power bus or whatever. A HBHF Sensor is used as
the input source but it doesn’t have to be. All that’s needed is a
constant source of power to keep the siphon active. When the sensor
outputs power, it will ‘SET’ the Memory Cell. This will force the Memory
Cell to flip outputs and send power through Output(right output). From
Output, power will be sent to an Electrical Branch configured to +2 over
the amount of power your circuit will need. The leftover power will pass
through Power Out and merge back into the Main Line. The power coming
out of Branch Out will go to another Electrical Branch that will be set
to the amount of power the circuit actually needs. The reason for +2 is
because 1rW is needed for the second Electrical Branch itself and 1rW
needs to be sent out Power Out to ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell. In the
blocked version, a Blocker was added before the first Electrical Branch
so it can hide the Active Usage caused by the Electrical Branches from a
battery. When the sensor stops sending power to ‘SET’, the power going
to ‘RESET’ will force the Memory Cell to flip outputs back to Inverted
Output and return power to the Main Line. In the blocked version,
because of the Electrical Branch on the Main Line, the Blocker will get
blocked again to hide the Active Usage.</p>
<p>The Manual siphons function in a very similar way only instead of
using ‘SET’ or ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell, ‘TOGGLE’ is used instead.
Everytime ‘TOGGLE’ receives power, the Memory Cell will flip outputs. A
Red Button is used in the pictured examples but it doesn’t have to be.
When it comes to which output on the Memory Cell is the Main Line or the
Circuit line, it really doesn’t matter because there is the ability to
manually control which output power is actively passing through.</p>
<p>In all the examples we have used Counters at each output. This is
only to show how much power each C-Bus costs to not be active. <a

<h1 id="short-circuit-max-depth"><a href="#short-circuit-max-depth"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit / Max Depth</h1>
<p>This is a single message that is displayed for 2 different errors. At
the time of creating this section, XOR Switches did not consume any
power which is why you will see them used in the pictures. The pictures
might get remade in time but power consumption is not important when
discussing and understanding this error.</p>
<h2 id="short-circuit"><a href="#short-circuit"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit</h2>
<p>A short circuit happens when you have power feeding back into itself,
AKA, a loop.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image124.png" /></p>
<p>Why would you do this? You wouldn’t. In the past, batteries
functioned differently and there was a need to create the “Infinite
Power Loop”. Today, batteries have something called “<a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Active
Usage</a>”. This breaks the infinite loop and eliminates a need for it
to exist.</p>
<p>You can circumvent a short circuit by increasing the number of
components in the loop to be 9 or greater.</p>
<p><img src="images/image10.png" /></p>
<p>In the next picture we show a battery feeding power back into
itself.</p>
<p><img src="images/image62.png" /></p>
<p>There is no reason to do this anymore. There was a time when
batteries could only exist in 1 state at a time. They were either
charging or discharging and when they were discharging, they were always
doing it at their max. Back then, people found a way to use the extra
power and send it back to the battery. For example, a large battery was
always outputting 100 power whereas today, they calculate an <a
href="powerstorage.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Active
Usage</a> and only drain the amount of power a circuit needs, up to 100.
Today, if the circuit only needs 50, the battery only gives 50.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is batteries also cause an active usage. For
a large battery, it is 400, so in the above loop, you are forcing a max
drain on the battery. There is no advantage to this.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="max-depth"><a href="#max-depth" class="anchor-link">*</a>Max
Depth</h2>
<p>Maximum Depth is referring to the number of components between your
power source and the  Root Combiner. A Max Depth error will occur when
we exceed 16 components.</p>
<p><img src="images/image101.png" /></p>
<p>It is important to understand this mechanic and how to calculate it.
This becomes important when combining multiple power sources including a
battery backup with multiple combined batteries. If you experience this
error, to calculate the depth of a circuit, we start with the last Root
Combiner or the combiner that is furthest away from the power source and
count the number of components power must pass through all the way back
to the power source. This limits where in a circuit you can use Root
Combiners.</p>
<p>The below images are 2 ways root combiners can be stacked. The group
on the left is known as pyramid stacking and the group on the right is
known as a daisy chain. While both groups are possible, you can see that
the group on the left is only 4 components deep whereas the right side
is 8 deep. This is important when working with a large amount of
centralized power because you can quickly use up the depth and then not
be able to have the number of batteries you want or need.</p>
<p><img src="images/image7.png" /></p>
<p>In this next image, we have 8 Windmills combined into a Nih Core with
a battery backup containing 6 Large Batteries. This circuit has a total
depth of 13 components. The trick to counting depth is counting the
components in the longest route from the last Root Combiner,
<strong>#1</strong> back to the Windmill, <strong>#13</strong>.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image99.png" /></p>
<p>In the next example, we have 2 isolated power sources. The first
source is the cluster of Windmills. The second is the combined Solar
Panels for the Component Destruction Detector. This means that we have 2
paths we must consider when calculating the depth. The first path to
look at is the one that goes from the Root Combiner <strong>#1</strong>
back to the Windmill <strong>#14</strong>. This path is the main power
path. The second path goes from Root Combiner <strong>#1</strong> back
to the Solar Panel <strong>#16</strong>. If one of these paths exceed
the Max Depth limit of 16 components, you will start to see the error
message at Root Combiner <strong>#1</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/image50.png" /></p>
<p>The next image shows a Max Depth using an equal number of Windmills
and Batteries with a Nih Core.</p>

<h1 id="circuit-delay-and-power-flow"><a
href="#circuit-delay-and-power-flow" class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuit
Delay and Power Flow</h1>
<h2 id="circuit-delay"><a href="#circuit-delay"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuit Delay</h2>
<p>Circuit Delay at its most basic, is the amount of time it takes power
to pass from one component to another. The amount of time we are talking
about is incredibly small but a lot of small increases will eventually
become a large amount of time. One way to test how fast rustricity is on
any server is by stringing a bunch of lights together, the more the
better, and watch how long it takes for all of them to turn on and off.
For this reason, it is impossible to say the specific amount of time it
takes for components to react but some do react slower or faster than
others.</p>
<p>All components that only have a power input and a passthrough power
output, will react at or around the same speed. These would be
components like lights. From the moment the light receives power to the
moment it sends power out, we will call this 1 unit of time. If power
passes through 2 lights, from the moment the first light receives power
to the moment the second light sends power out, we can call this 2 units
of time. The time it takes to pass through 3 lights, we call 3 units of
time.</p>
<p>Components with multiple outputs have their own delay, 1 for each
output. For example, the Splitter, it has 3 outputs. Power is sent out 1
output at a time. The amount of time from the moment the Splitter
receives power to the time the last output sends power out is equal to 1
unit of time. The Electrical Branch sends power through Power Out first
then Branch Out and this is equal to 2 units of time. On the Memory
Cell, it needs 3 units of time to flip outputs.</p>
<p>Batteries also have their own delay. When a battery has an Active
Usage of 0, it enters an ‘Off’ state. When the time comes for the
battery to power something, it must enter an ‘On’ state which has a
delay equal to 2 units of time. Keeping the battery in the ‘On’ state
with a Root Combiner or an Industrial Light eliminates the delay so you
have power right away.</p>
<h2 id="power-flow"><a href="#power-flow" class="anchor-link">*</a>Power
Flow</h2>
<p>Power Flow is the path electricity takes through a circuit and the
order of the path, aka the order of operation. We need to remember that
Rustricity is nothing more than lines of code that are processed 1 after
another. Not only does this create a Circuit Delay, as explained above,
it also only allows 1 component at a time to perform an action. This
creates the order of operation.</p>
<p>Using the picture below to help illustrate, when we flip on the
Switch, light 1 will power on followed by light 2 then light 3 and
finally light 4. When we flip the Switch off, light 1 will power
offfollowed by light 2 then light 3 and finally light 4. Power flow gets
alittle more complicated when we introduce components with
multipleoutputs.</p>
<p><img src="images/passtrough-chain.png" /></p>
<p>Starting with the Electrical Branch that has 2 outputs, power is
first sent through Power Out then power gets sent through Branch Out.
When it is removed, it will first be removed from Power Out then Branch
Out.</p>
<p><img src="images/branch-outputs.png" /></p>
<p>The Splitter is similar but it has 3 outputs. Power first goes
through Power Out 1 followed by Power Out 2 then Power Out 3. When power
is removed, it will be removed first from Power Out 1 followed by Power
Out 2 then Power Out 3.</p>
<p><img src="images/splitter-out.png" /></p>
<p>The Memory Cell is another component that has 2 outputs. Even though
it only sends power through 1 output at a time, Output will always react
before Inverted Output. This means that when we apply power to ‘Set’,
power will be sent out the Output first before we lose power from the
Inverted Output. When we apply power to ‘Reset’, we will first lose
power from Output before power is sent out the Inverted Output.</p>
<p><img src="images/powerflowmemcell.png" /></p>
<p>Looking at these components at the individual level should be fairly
easy to understand. When we combine components with multiple outputs, we
will start to create a semi-predictable path. Using the below image, we
know that the Electrical Branch will send power through Power Out first
before sending power through Branch Out. It will do this before either
Splitter attached to them will react. This gives us the following order
of operation, 1 through 8.</p>
<p><img src="images/powerflueebsplit.png" /></p>
<p>The Memory Cell acts similarly to the Electrical Branch. 1 output
will react before the other, the only difference is 1 output is losing
power while the other is gaining power. Let’s say we are going to flip
power from the Inverted Output to the Output. 1- Output will send out
power first. 2- Inverted Output will lose power next. 3, 4 and 5 will
send out power one at a time in order, followed by 6, 7 and 8 losing
power one at a time, in order. The order of operation is the exact same
when flipping power back over to Inverted Output from Output.</p>
<p><img src="images/powerflowmemsplit.png" /></p>
<p>So far we have been talking about components sending power or losing
power. There is another side to Power Flow and that is the order in
which a component receives power. Some components require power first
before getting toggled while with others, it doesn’t matter what input
gets power first, they will react once powered on.</p>
<p>Let’s start with components that will react no matter what input gets
power first.</p>
<p><code>Memory Cell</code> - It doesn’t matter if the side inputs or
the main input gets power first. Once the main input receives power, it
will put itself into the correct configuration based on what side inputs
are receiving power.</p>
<p><img src="images/memcellpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Counter</code> - Sending power to the side inputs, it will
count up or down and clear with no power provided to the main input.
Only once power is provided to the main input will the screen turn on to
display the number. If the number shown is the same as the target
number, power will be sent through.</p>
<p><img src="images/cntrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>RAND Switch</code> - Sending power to the side inputs will Set
and Reset the RAND Switch with no power provided to the main input. Only
once power is provided to the main input will power pass through or not
depending on the state of the switch. The side inputs only react when
they are provided with power. Having constant power on them when the
main power is removed or received will not affect the switch and it will
remain in the same state.</p>
<p><img src="images/randpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Blocker</code> - Sending power to the side input before sending
power to the main input will block power from passing through. However,
if you send power to the main input first and the very next operation,
send power to the side input, it should still block power from passing
through. If the delay between sending power to the main input then to
the side input is long enough, power will get sent through before it
gets blocked.</p>
<p><img src="images/blckrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p>The following components require power to their main input first
before sending power to their secondary inputs.</p>
<p><code>Electric Furnace</code> - If you want to use the secondary
inputs to turn the furnace on or off, you must send power to the main
input first. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the
main input receives power, the furnace will remain in whatever state it
was in before the main input lost power.</p>
<p><img src="images/frncpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Conveyor</code> - If you want to use the secondary inputs to
turn the conveyor on or off, you must send power to the main input
first. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the main
input receives power, the conveyor will remain in whatever state it was
in before the main input lost power.</p>
<p><img src="images/cnvyrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Timer</code> - If you want to use the secondary input to toggle
the timer on, you must first send power to the main input. If you send
power to the secondary input first, when the main input receives power,
the timer will not toggle on.</p>
<p><img src="images/tmrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Boom Box</code> -If you want to use the secondary input to
toggle the boom box on to play music, you must first send power to the
main input. If you send power to the secondary input first, when the
main input receives power, the boom box will not toggle on and not play
music.</p>
<p><img src="images/mbmxpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p><code>Elevator</code> - If you want to use the secondary inputs to
call the elevator to a floor, you must first send power to the main
input. If you send power to the secondary inputs first, when the main
input receives power, the elevator will not be called to a floor.</p>
<p><img src="images/lvtrpwrflw.png" /></p>
<p>We have covered how power flow is affected by components with
multiple outputs. We have covered components that are affected by the
order they receive power flow. The last piece of the puzzle is something
I don’t have enough information to properly explain atm. It appears that
the game can prioritize some components over another. I hope to one day
be able to explain this in detail but to help illustrate how a complex
circuit behaves, I have broken down the Nih Core to show the order of
operation.</p>
<p><img src="images/nihcorepowbat2.png" /></p>
<p>The left side shows the order of operation when switching from
battery backup to windmill power.</p>

that makes sense. Please comment on the <a

<h1 id="side-inputs"><a href="#side-inputs"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Side Inputs</h1>
<p>They are not bugged or broken, you just don’t know how to use them
yet.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for people to think of ‘Switch On’ and ‘Switch
Off’ as a toggle like on the side of a Timer. They are not toggles, they
are inputs with an added function. Just like the ‘Power In’ on the
bottom, the side inputs also pass power through to the top. The function
part only functions when power is received, removed or the amount of
power is updated.</p>
<p>When ANY input on the Switch receives an “update”, the Switch will
bind to that input for its source of power that passes through to the
top. It will remain bound to that input until another input “updates”
which will force the switch to bind to the new input. An update is
either losing power or receiving power, 0-1 or 1-0 or power levels
change up or down.</p>
<p>The exception to this is when one input is receiving an amount of
power and another input receives the same amount of power, the Switch
will not recognize the new source and remain bound to the original
input.</p>
<p>The following pictures will help illustrate how it works.</p>
<p>Starting off, we are using 3 Switches to provide 3 different amounts
of power each input. Green wire is for Switch On. Red wire is for Switch
Off. Black wire is for Electric Input on the bottom. Yellow lines mark
the path power is taking. Red lines mark where power stops. In this
first picture, we are sending power to the bottom input and the Switch
sends it out the top, with the expected power loss.</p>
<p>Next, we leave power going into the bottom and then apply power to
Switch Off. As we can see, the Switch will flip off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image41.png" /></p>
<p><img src="images/image13.png" /></p>
<p>If we manually flip the Switch back on, we can now see a new amount
of power displaying on the counter.</p>
<p><img src="images/image75.png" /></p>
<p>This is because the Switch is now bound to the Switch Off input for
the power that passes through to the top. The power going into the
bottom input is completely ignored. For the next picture, we flip the
Switch back off and then apply power to Switch On.</p>
<p><img src="images/image64.png" /></p>
<p>The Switch will now flip on and once again pass through a new amount
of power to the counter. The power going to the bottom input or Switch
Off input is now ignored and the Switch is bound to Switch On. In the
next picture, we remove power from Switch On while keeping power applied
to Switch Off and the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="images/image30.png" /></p>
<p>We can see here now that power was removed from Switch On, the Switch
has no power. The green light turns off and the Switch is still in the
on position. Even though the other 2 inputs have power, the Switch is
bound to Switch On for its source of power, which was removed. If we
restore power to Switch On, the Switch will start passing power though
again like the previous picture. With power restored, for the next
picture we will remove power from Switch Off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image44.png" /></p>
<p>We restored power to Switch On before removing power from Switch Off.
The green light turns off when power is removed and the Switch binds to
the Switch Off. This is because that input received an update from
‘having power’ to ‘not having power’, from 1 to 0. For the next picture,
we restore power to Switch Off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image53.png" /></p>
<p>Restoring power to the Switch Off input, the red light turns on and
the Switch flips to the off position. When we manually flip it on we can
see the new amount of power passing through.</p>
<p><img src="images/image105.png" /></p>
<p>Seeing that we only have 28 power showing on the counter, it is clear
power is coming through the Switch Off input. When we remove power from
the bottom input, the Switch loses power.</p>
<p><img src="images/image73.png" /></p>
<p>It loses power because the bottom input was updated, from 1 to 0, so
the Switch bound to it. Now bound to the bottom input and not receiving
power, the green light turns off and no power passes through. Restoring
power to the bottom input, the green light turns back on and the new
power amount is displayed on the counter.</p>
<p><img src="images/image126.png" /></p>
<p>Seeing the power level on the counter confirming power is coming into
the bottom, we will now adjust the Electrical Branch to send more power
to Switch On.</p>
<p><img src="images/image116.png" /></p>
<p>After increasing the amount of power, we can see an instant change on
the counter to reflect that the Switch changed the input it was bound to
from the bottom input to Switch On.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whichever is the last input to receive an update is
the input the Switch will bind to for its source of power. Adding power,
removing power or a change in power levels will update the Switches
input. When moving power from one input to another, it is important</p>
